Bitter darkness has churned within your blood and stomach since the day you first tasted the foul fruits of death. Violence and death spills a power into the world, and in a quasi-physical act, you may consume it, rendering from it aether. The more harm is done, the more of this death energy is created; the more psychic trauma involved, the longer it clings to the world. So the peaceful death of a sapient creates a vast amount of energy that dissipates within a day; while a trivial but torturous injury inflicted intentionally, by one consumed with hate on a panicking other will produce minimal energy that’s usable for a year or more. Sapients generate an order of magnitude more than non-sapients, and it’s usually longer lasting too: a human being dying makes more Aether than ten average necrophages could consume at once. For Necrophagy, **tax is not based on strength of draw**, but rather, range. If you are adjacent to the energy, no tax, while 100 meters is a strong draw. Necrophagy can also sustain you, replacing food, water, and air instead of granting aether. However, consuming too much death energy (for aether or otherwise) leaves its mark, causing you to appear wasted or injured, and your spiritual form becomes dim and bleak. If you cease using Necrophagy, you’ll recover in about as much time as you’ve been under the wasting (perhaps longer in extreme cases).
