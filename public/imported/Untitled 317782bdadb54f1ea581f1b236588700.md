- ^ Your wards against magic can now protect against even the subtlest magical effects; including divination.
- ^ You may now weave wards that block subtler physical phenomena, allowing you to blur sight, or block radio waves, or nullify sound.
- ^ Your wards can now be tuned to block selectively, such as only blocking things moving above a certain speed, or to block only some types of matter, or allow some people through but not others. The wards sensitivity is at most equal to your own (though can include magical effects); eg, you can't make a ward that will sieve only fresh water from the ocean unless you are personally capable of perceiving and sorting out the salt molecules; and any disguise that would fool you would fool your wards.
- ^ You can tune wards to have greater effect against one particular magic or type of attack at the expense of durability against others.
