A twisted black flask. It filters death and dismay from the world to incubate deadly spirits. When anyone opens the flask and pours it out with intention, they summon one to six wraiths: potent spiritual combatants. They can fly rapidly (faster than cars) and though they aren't truly intelligent, they wield poltergeist like abilities with cunning savagery. They can perceive the physical world, conjure winds and hurl objects chaotically, cause fear and hallucinations, sap heat and light from places and life from living things they touch. They can track living beings and some other things by the traces they leave in the spirit world (a difficult track to cover). Though they obey the one that summoned them, they can't understand complex tasks and their inherent violence is hard to restrain. At max the bottle holds enough power to summon one spirit for 36 hours; the minimum is one hour per spirit. It typically refills completely in three months, but a pandemic or war can double that.
