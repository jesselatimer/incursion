Spells:

- You can cast divination spells that are built on your inherent door instincts, but are longer range and more accurate and specific.
- You may create temporary doors through solid barriers. By default they look like a faintly exotic door from your own memory or imagination, but if you’re skilled at molding aether, you can make it look like any type of portal; it is not possible to camouflage its existence as a door. No matter how long the door’s passage should be, even if it’s through a mountain, it never looks or feels more than a foot or so deep. Costs are based on how thick and strong the wall or barrier is; it’s more expensive to make portals through barriers that aren’t proper manmade walls. Costs raise exponentially for thickness. Duration is increased greatly when you’re touching your door, so it is low cost to make a door that exists only long enough for you to go through it; but a typical energy expenditure will last half an hour.
