- You may cast a spell on doors causing them to open to the Hall of Doors. This extradimensional space is a vast, shifting labyrinth of many materials and forms, laid out in strange and twisting paths: but every wall is lined with doors of every possible type and appearance. These doors connect to every door in the primary world (and more besides), so you need only open one to return to Earth, unless the corresponding door is open in the real world, in which case the Hall door cannot be affected. The distance between doors in The Hall is correlated with their distance in the real world, but almost always much closer together, making it easy to rapidly travel between human occupied areas. Because of the terrain, including narrow halls, bridges, stairs, etc, vehicles are hard to use there, and even riding animals is difficult. It is occasionally occupied, both by other thaumaturges with access, and by stranger things. The layout shifts at times.
- In The Hall you may cast divination spells to find a specific door (or perhaps with enough skill and by combining with other divinations, doors meeting some criteria, eg, “Near my friend,”). Divination may fail without enough aether, which is required based on the door’s distance from the last place you were in the real world, and how secured the door is.
