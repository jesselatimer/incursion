A gray stone, warm to the touch. Hold it, imagine changing, and your old self and the stone collapse to ash, from which the new you arises. In the timeless place between existences, you configure the new you as if playing a simple CYOA. Choose a new appearance, physical and mental traits, and, if desired, alter your personality and manipulate your memories. You can even choose new "background" traits, that might give you wealth, connections, skills, languages, or other things. The Stone cannot alter other people's memories, but by default it grants a permanent glamour that distracts people from questioning any changes, or being alarmed if they are pointed out. Upgrades can generate new documentation, or even find a family willing to behave as if you'd been with them all along. And of course the “new you” could easily be the old you, plus some money, beauty, strength or diligence.
