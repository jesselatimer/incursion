Youâ€™ve formed a symbiotic relationship with a swarm of small spiritual entities that subsist on violent energies. They hover around you, invisible and intangible, consuming the physical or spiritual energy from acts of violence that would otherwise affect you. They eat magical blasts, drink momentum from physical attacks, and metabolize harmful curses. They can be overwhelmed by a single powerful enough attack, or sated by a volume of them. They breed and thrive when well-fed, enabling them to eat more and faster. But starvation wreaks havoc on their numbers, starting as soon as a week without food. If enough of them die of starvation, the remainder will enter a hibernation that will require significant time and resources to bring them out of. Note that despite the varying physical effects, they are actually consuming the violent intent, the desire to harm. This violent intent will linger on a trap, or cling to a bullet fired by a friend but intended for someone else; but blows traded in sparring, natural disasters, or normal backfires of weapons or abilities are not food for the eaters, and will harm you without impediment.
