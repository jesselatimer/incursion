A spiritual weight has burrowed into your soul and made its home there. It normally shields you from most of the effects of its presence, but when called forth by a spell this Talent will unravel nearby spells and slow spirits.

Inherent: There is a sense of pressure and weight around you, which some people may find calming and others off-putting; spiritual beings in your presence tend to be subdued.
