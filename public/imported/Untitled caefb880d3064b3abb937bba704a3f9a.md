Thaumaturges, other mages, and even nature can create things of magical power. But these are special, plausibly unique, possibly born of the Incursion directly. The pull of fate ties it to you, deterring loss or damage, but this protection isn't absolute. And of course intentionally giving one away severs the tie. Each artifact takes 1 Bond.
