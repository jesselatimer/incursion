You're in the good graces of the foremost "supernatural threat countermeasure equipped" private military company in the world. Monster hunts; magically enhanced security for regions, facilities, or individuals; specialized extractions; or augmenting military operations for countries across the world; they do it all with their eclectic staff of capable thaumaturges and other specialists. Expect occasional free services (”Training exercises for the rookies!”), tactical advice, priority, and cut rates. Aside from direct action, you can employ their thaumaturgical medical staff, artificers, or engineers. You have a standing offer to join at lieutenant rank if you care to (and are willing to undergo their grueling training course). Note that while they have high standards of conduct and professionality, they are mercenaries for a reason, and are generally not nice people. They will never violate their contracts, but won't follow you into literal hell (there's a clause about that).
