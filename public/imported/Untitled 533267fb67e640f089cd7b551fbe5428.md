Spells:

- You become capable of casting spells that make temporary trade-offs with your vision—some call it opening the third eye. Your perception of the “real world” is reduced, becoming dim and blurry, but you see patterns and auras, lines of light and shadow that reveal connections between things and echoes of the past and future. You can see, eg, auras of spells cast, even after the effects have faded; lines of light that demonstrate relationships, eg, an old grudge connects two people; auras of manifest Intentions, such as “the desire to conceal” around a hidden door or illusion; blotches and shadows that represent hidden weaknesses, physical or otherwise. When this spell is active, any person in your field of vision gets a prickly sense of being watched. You can attempt to tune for a preferred effect or focus, but failure will result in the wrong one, or useless, uninterpretable vision. A typical aether expenditure lasts an hour.
