- ^Your spells can now partially revert flesh into original material, allowing you to remold healthy flesh. With advanced skill, this is useful for fixing deformities or performing "plastic surgery", but it also allows you to use your healing spells to replace missing limbs or organs, though this still requires time and skill (for whatever reason, Old Flesh makes excellent kidneys and teeth). Adding features that weren't part of the original creature (a tail, scales, etc) requires virtuoso skill, not to mention some amount of medical knowledge, and there's no guarantee it won't fail anyways. NB: limitations on malformation still apply.
- You can also only partially convert original material, creating animated figures of a living clay-flesh substance. The figures are not really sapient, but can interpret your orders (and only yours), they are strong and indefatigable, but can be clumsy, doubly so if they're not a standard shape like an ox or humanoid. They reserve some of your conduit as long as they are active, time to create and reservation are based on size.
