A well of fiery strength bubbles within you, seeking to twist, rend and burn. This Talent grants you the power to transform into a powerful war form.

Inherent: Your teeth and nails become harder. You are given a constant trickle of adrenaline that you never become tolerant to, making it harder to relax, but having its enhancing effects and making you ready to burst into full fight or flight mode at any moment. The "imp of the perverse", that desire to crush something you're holding or veer directly into traffic, is much more common for you than for most. You gain some mastery of your anger, and are able to call it forth or suppress it with ease.
