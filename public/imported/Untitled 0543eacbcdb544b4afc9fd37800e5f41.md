Spells:

- You can summon a cloud of the Dark Smoke to your immediate vicinity. You may set the cloud to a specific task as part of the casting (how well they follow your design is based on your clarity of instruction and skill in the Method used), or continuously direct it. The cloud moves slowly, but is rather strong, allowing it to carve wood or most stones, bend thinner metals; as well as very precise, letting it do deft sewing jobs, precisely apply glues or electronic components. It is coherent enough, but barely, to channel liquids through it. And if it can get underneath something, even a small cloud can (slowly) shift literal tons. Note that the natural magical immune system of people prevents clouds from chewing into them or entering their body, but it can restrain and move people. Clouds from one casting must stay contiguous (and if you are directing them, it must connect to you as well), and if forcibly broken up (such as by an air tight door closing) the smaller part (or the part not connected to you) fades back out of existence. The smoke is heavier than air, but only just, allowing it to stack itself high tower, or float on water. It is almost opaque. It becomes even slower at freezing or boiling temperatures, and if it becomes too hot, or contacts an open flame, the entire cloud combusts violently, like a flour bomb. A typical aether expenditure makes about a dozen cubic feet of smoke that lasts for half an hour; aether cost is linear with volume.
