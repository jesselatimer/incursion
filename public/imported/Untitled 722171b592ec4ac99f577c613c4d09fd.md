These enormous elemental beings look as if small lost corners of the Earth itself had been carved into vaguely humanoid forms and stood up under their own power. Enigmatic ruins drowned in lakes, collapsed under mountains, or choked with forest dwell and move in some liminal space askew from normal reality. In this place they carved the world and are involved with its continued operation. They vary in scale from “medium sized building” to “clouds about their shoulders”. Normally utterly disinterested in the affairs of mortals, they seem to have a curious soft spot for you particularly, almost adopting you as a youngest sibling.

However, their minds are not as mortal minds, they have their own understandings and priorities of the world. They might rush to defend you, but their notion of what is or is not a threat, and what is appropriate and proportionate retaliation can be very different from yours. Without asking they might hurl a pickpocket into the sun (still holding your wallet), or other times might decide that if you’re trapped in that death trap it’s because you want to be and they shouldn’t interfere. Sometimes they might kidnap you from whatever else you’re doing (surely it doesn’t matter that much!) to look at the cool stonehenge they’re building in a cave under the ocean.

Their nature allows them to travel quickly to any place on earth, and the sight of a clear day suddenly falling into shadow as they block the sun along with the sound of ground-shaking footsteps becomes commonplace to you. They view you as they might a younger sibling, with fondness and protectiveness, and sometimes annoyance. They will come to your aid if you are being abused or are outmatched in a fight (as long as they aren't doing something more interesting at the time!). They will sometimes defend you from things you don't need defending from, such as literally throwing a pickpocket who stole your wallet into the sun. Wallet and all. They frequently have their own ideas about how to protect you, such as deciding they don't feel like fighting that day and so whisking you to the Himalayas to help them build a new Stonehenge. They make up for this independent streak by being good-natured, fierce, and willing to fight to the death for you. Being born of raw elemental force, they are nearly impossible to kill, so this is rather a lot of fight. If ever your purposes and intentions fully align, the world itself could crack and sunder.
