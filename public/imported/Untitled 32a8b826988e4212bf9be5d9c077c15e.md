An unadorned key. Use it on an appropriately sized door (somehow, even one without a lock), and you create temporary passage to the dancing house (which is actually an immobile apartment, askew from reality). The door in the apartment has a peephole showing the area around the "external doorway", and you can open it to again create temporary passage there (or nearby if that is obstructed). The apartment is relatively secure, but there exists magic that allows tracking and infiltrating it. The apartment is in good repair, has high ceilings, three bedrooms, one-and-a-half baths, and a large kitchen. The windows don't open, but show landscape and weather appropriate to the location of the external door, but slightly surreal. It came to you furnished with regular, if a bit dated furniture. It summons or creates water and electricity, free but with monthly limits. A trick cast with the key can create a data link, connecting, eg, a location's internet or cellular coverage to the dancing house. This lasts about a month before it must be renewed. The house cleans and repairs its structures, but severe enough damage causes it to immediately eject any living occupants, and stay sealed for the one to six months it needs to repair itself.
