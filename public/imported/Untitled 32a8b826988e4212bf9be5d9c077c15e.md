An unadorned modern key. When you touch it to the lock of an appropriately sized door, it will open to a pleasant apartment that neither dances nor is a house. The door in the apartment has a peephole showing the area around the external doorway, and if opened, will let out there. The external door will behave normally, otherwise. If the external door is destroyed, or left open, or that space is occupied or unsafe (eg, the room it was in collapsed or flooded), it will instead open through a nearby door, or a temporary magical portal if there are none within a few dozen meters. Though it is relatively secure, people with the right magic might be able to follow you. The apartment is three bedroom, one-a-half bath, has high ceilings, and a large kitchen with all the amenities. It comes with decent but non-magical furnishings which may be replaced at will (the entertainment center is quite dated, for instance). It has a large but finite daily allotment of electricity and water. A trick cast with the key can magically link information services (eg, Internet, TV, cellular data) to the dancing house. The windows (which do not open) all show faintly unreal views appropriate for the locale and time of the external door. Any severe damage to the apartment will eject any living occupants immediately, and require some time (one to six months) to repair itself and be usable.
