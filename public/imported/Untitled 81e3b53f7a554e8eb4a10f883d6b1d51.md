A large, ornate wooden armoire has, against all reason, chosen to follow you around, radiating goodwill and cheerfulness. It is animated, and can twist and hop about, though a lot of the time it simply appears where it needs to be. You might, for example, check into a hotel and find it already installed in the closet. It is extremely durable (though not indestructible), and can regenerate from some damage. It does not talk, yet you somehow receive an impression of its attitude and opinions just by looking at it. It is not by nature aggressive, but if necessary will interpose itself between you and harm, or even tip slowly over onto things that will not otherwise be stopped, crushing them with absurd supernatural weight.

Thaumaturgy(?): *Convenient Spaces*

Its animation alone is obviously magical, but it also seems to have other natural magical properties like a glamour that makes people pay less attention to it, as well as whatever lets it be where it needs to be to serve you. Whenever it opens up, it seems to have just what you need, whether thatâ€™s a freshly tailored and pressed suit, an arsenal of weapons, food for three, or in some emergencies, or a portal to a place outside of time (DO NOT LET THE LION TOUCH YOU HE IS NOT A REAL MESSIAH). It does seem to have some limits to the amount of material it can produce, or have outside of it, similar to a need to reserve capacity.
