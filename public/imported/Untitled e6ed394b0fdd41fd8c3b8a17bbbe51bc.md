A snapshot of yourself is preserved outside of time, only your memories changing as you walk to the deep future.

Inherent: Your sense of proprioception is heightened; no longer limited to a rough understanding of your bodyâ€™s position, you instead know exactly how every part of your body is positioned relative to every other part, including internal organs and other parts of your body you normally would not sense. Your level of fidelity with this sense is roughly 1 millimeter.
