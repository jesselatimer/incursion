The depths of the ocean were strange and unknown even before the Incursion, and now the abyss is a true mystery; but the whispers of that murk suffuse you and change you. This Talent offers spells for physical transformation to a water adapted form.

Inherent: This Talent causes a durable mutation (ie, these features slowly re-manifest if you change them with magic or surgery): your eyes grow a bit larger and slightly yellow, your skin becomes a touch moist. Typical levels of cold and heat cease to bother you (you’re comfortable naked from near freezing to 110°F), but you are very uncomfortable if it’s too dry, it cracks your skin and gives you headaches.
