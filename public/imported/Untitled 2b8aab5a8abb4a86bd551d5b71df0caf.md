Somewhere in a place and time askew from this one, in the midst of an eternal storm, there is a massive block of something colder than any ice. You touched it, leaving a bloody print of each of your hands. The cold sensation never leaves you. This Talent grants access to spells that supernaturally improve your sense of touch and manual dexterity.

Inherent: Your hands change shape slightly, becoming longer and finer. They always feel cold, both to you and others. From wrist to fingertip they are also more sensitive. Your penmanship improves immediately, and you can write in fine cursive even if you couldnâ€™t before.
