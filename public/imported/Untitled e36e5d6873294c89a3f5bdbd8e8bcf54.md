A primordial spirit of nature has entered your service. Being a pure spirit, it is invisible to any (other than you) that don't have metaphysical sight. The form it takes is always large, dangerous, and evocative of the natural world; such as a giant bear with a moss hung deer skull for a head. Its strength waxes and wanes in proportion to how touched the place you’re in has been by human hands. But so long as the biosphere exists it cannot be permanently destroyed, but it can be temporarily overcome and suppressed. It defends you from spiritual threats. It will offer advice (sought or no) with its ancient wisdom. It will entreat flora and fauna on your behalf, potentially gaining knowledge, warding away predators, or aiding you in finding food and shelter. It can create a recuperative womb in soil or plants that will heal those inside over a day, but this takes up its full attention. Its most overt power is to invest itself into you, one of your boon companions, or the land around you. People or animals so filled enter a berserker frenzy, with greatly increased strength, speed, durability, and brutality; though they will always still be able to recognize friend from foe. The land, when given power, will rise up to fight on your behalf: plants will entangle, ground shift, wind howl, animals will become aggressive and turn on your foes. You are nature’s avatar, and it will vent its wrath through you.
