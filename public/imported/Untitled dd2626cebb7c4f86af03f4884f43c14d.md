Sometimes, fate grants us great boons, but only to prepare us for harrowing trials ahead. Yet the greatest trials yield the greatest rewards. And you, through no fault of your own, may suffer up to two of these.

**Even if not chosen, each Threat has a default presence in the world, as described under “Baseline”.** Read all of these or don’t, they’ll be present in your reality, but may not affect your life.

When you select a Threat, you enter a version of the world that is significantly more dangerous, as described under “Threat”, but in so doing you become a fulcrum on which the fate of that world is balanced, and gain new powers to match, listed under “Boon”. Each Threat also lists a “Victory” condition; if you are instrumental in achieving it, you also receive the rewards listed.

As an important note: threats will *always* compound. There is no combination of threats that allows, eg, playing one off against another, and in fact, the ones involving sentient enemies will usually involve them working together.

Nothing specifically compels you to complete the victory condition for a given Threat--but if you do not actively work to overcome it, each Threat will continue to grow.
