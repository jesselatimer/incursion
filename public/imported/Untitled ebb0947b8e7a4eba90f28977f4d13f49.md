Throughout history devout souls have withdrawn to lives of seclusion and contemplation. And in these isolated lives they have found something in common with each other, even across religious lines. You don't know how long this nameless, globe-spanning, pan-ecumenical organization has existed, but they certainly seemed well-prepared for the Incursion. Their mission statement is to secure the souls of humanity against supernatural threats. They have taken near total secrecy as a core principle; and with a global reach, deft touch, and mastery of subtlety, they go unknown to the populace. But not to you. Whether you know somebody in the org, or are one of their deniable "free assets", you know when to look at the edges of events, to spot the monks in black. And you can go to them for help. They don't want to show their hand, but they might offer a good tip at just the right time, or—especially for a good cause—they can let you access their safe houses. All over the world, sanctuaries that are simply the safest places in the world against supernatural threats. Secured by more than just thaumaturgy, impenetrable to divination or uninvited creatures, they regularly staffed by medical, anti-curse, or masters of revealing hidden evil. Many even have limited, conditional mechanisms for teleportation or similar condensed paths between them.
