- You can cast spells that actually physically transform you into a magical water dwelling creature. That is, your transformation is as above but does not end, and cannot be somehow reverted or canceled. This requires about as much aether as 8 hours of the temporary transformation would.
- You also gain spells that transform you back to your original human shape (only reverting the Call of the Deep or other aquatic transformations, not others).
