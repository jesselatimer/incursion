- You may drain emotions, bolstering yourself and weakening another temporarily. Aether demand is from range and number of subjects; but strength of effect and duration are based only on the strength of the emotion. You feel the associated emotion more strongly, see the associated hue more brightly, and gain a supernatural strength. In general: yellow is positive feelings (happiness, pride), and improves your health; red ones are related to anger (hatred, irritation) and enhance your strength or agility; blue, sad emotions (bitterness, boredom, grief) heal and restore your mind; green fearful ones grant clarity of thought. The person drained has the inverse effect as you, for about twice as long as you have the strength, muted emotion, drab color vision, and weakness in some aspect.
