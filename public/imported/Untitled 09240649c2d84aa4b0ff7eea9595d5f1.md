Spells:

- You can cast divination spells that expand the range or increase the sensitivity of your seismic sense. Detecting something like people walking is a virtuoso skill, but most users can, eg, feel cars moving anywhere in range.
- You can cast divination spells to predict seismic activity, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions; this works to about a month in advance (skill decides accuracy; increased aether grants greater range in space and time but also greater uncertainty).
- You can cast spells that shove volumes of earth, stone, and related materials around, violently enough to be used as a weapon. The material to be moved must be touching ground that you are also touching. Aether is expended based on both mass affected and force applied. Tectonia alone has poor resolution: you can't control mass smaller than a head or so. But you can open pits, dig trenches and tunnels, collapse or build walls. You can use these spells to shove yourself through the ground like a mole, or surf on the crest of a moving wave of earth.
