Dreams have always been magical, but since the Incursion, it's a much more practical magic. Whether from some ineffable deity or the world of dreams itself, you're the recipient of a boon: your own persistent, private dominion in the realm of dreams. You can visit whenever you sleep, and you may now choose to nod off (or wake!) at will. You're fully lucid here. You can shape it arbitrarily, choose what rules apply, assume any shape, manifest anything you can imagine clearly enough, and even fashion intelligent-seeming beings out of dream-cloth. Of course you can relax and play away from the stress of the world, but you can also make plans and tactics, review the dayâ€™s activities, and train mental skills. Part of your realm is a memory palace, letting you view some of your memories, and even help organize them; your attention to it affects how you remember and think about things in the real world. Woe betide any of those rare monsters or magicians that can enter dreams, and choose to invade yours. In your realm or not, your sleep is always deep and restful, and somehow, even your daydreams are clearer and more pleasant.
