You are the beneficiary of an agreement with or boon from a dream-god. When you dream, you can choose to go to a stable and persistent dream world where you are lucid and have dominion. You can shape the realm, choose what rules you like, assume any shape, manifest anything you can imagine clearly enough, and fashion intelligent-seeming beings out of dream-cloth. Here, you may just relax and destress, but you can also make plans and tactics, review the dayâ€™s activities, and train mental skills, including the non-physical aspects of martial or other physical arts (reflexes, movements, forms, but not strength, speed, etc.). Your dream-realm contains a memory-palace in some form--a place you can store specific memories or knowledge for quick and careful retrieval. As part of the pact, you can fall asleep at any time, and your sleep is always deep and restful, or enter a daydreaming trance, allowing limited access to your dream realm while still minimally aware of the real world.
