The world makes a noise for you; it sounds like dice tumbling, or cards shuffling, its pitch and tenor changing with events. Sortition grants limited fate magic: specifically the ability to predict the future, and at higher levels, direct it.

Inherent: Your intuition for probability improves; not necessarily what the outcome of some random event will be, but what a distribution should "feel" like. You have a sixth sense for when things that should be random aren't (eg, loaded dice or poorly shuffled cards).
