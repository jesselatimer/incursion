Somewhere in the back of your mind is a buzz of whispers, a perpetual rippling exchange of trades and offers. You have a connection to a colloquy of great spirits and forces, as well as other thaumaturges, and so participate in a “spiritual energy market” from which you may obtain aether. The market is mostly robust, and in the long term, the median amount of aether for a given strength draw is ~110% compared to reference Arcane Font; however, there are lulls and spikes, as well as boom and bust periods where for hours to months draws may be up to twice or half as efficient. You will know exactly what rate you’ll receive at any given moment, but predicting the market in advance is about as difficult as predicting the real world economic market. On the downside, as part of participating on the market, at times your own spiritual energy becomes “illiquid”: almost randomly, one to four times a week, a few percent of your conduit is reserved. This condition lasts about a day. Your connection to the spiritual market gives you a type of vague sense of the global magical happenings, meaning you have a chance to notice if something very significant happens, as if a million brokers cried out and were suddenly silent (such as a mass migration or die off of magical beings, major thaumaturgical battles, a world affecting ritual, etc).

*The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.*
