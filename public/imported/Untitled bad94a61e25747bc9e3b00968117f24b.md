- Your understanding of the skeins of fate allow you to make spells both more generic and more specific: you can now cast spells that grant good luck or bad luck generally. This nudges events around the person to their favor or detriment (respectively). Specificity is not possible. An average amount of energy might grant a month of minor fortune or burn out in one day by preventing an otherwise nearly certain fatal accident. Casting a luck blessing on yourself is several times as expensive as the same effect on someone else.
- You may cast Wyrds. This fates someone to a given end (often their death; whatever it is, it must be something that has a chance of happening to them naturally), however it must always include an “out” of some sort, which must be realistically achievable by them. “You will marry my cousin Brunhilda if you do not slay 100 enemies in the next year.” (or might be as low as 5 enemies if the subject is not part of a country at war.) “You will die if you do not retrieve and give to me the Pearl of the Moon.” “You will always lose to me in battle unless you bear the legendary blade of Albion.” A wyrd is always expensive to cast, and the shorter the time span, the more potent the fate, and the more constrained the time frame, the more the cost increases.
