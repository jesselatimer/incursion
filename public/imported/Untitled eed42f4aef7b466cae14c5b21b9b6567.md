All the world’s a stage, and a part of you has gained a new point of view on it, more like a director than a viewer or player; you can impose reified diegetic elements onto that play. With this talent you may craft hypnotic-suggestive effects called “glamours”.

Inherent: You become a much better actor. You can convey very subtle things with your demeanor and expect people to pick up on them. Despite not changing in literal appearance in the slightest, you are automatically perceived as more attractive (unless you don’t want to be, of course). Be careful though, you may be able to tell convincing lies, but this power doesn’t help you keep them straight.
