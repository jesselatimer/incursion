You speak the secret language of the incandescent soul. Pyromancers forge magic with the internal fire of their passion and release it by the gates of their mouths. Burning conviction and voluble emotion fuels the best pyromancers; and the greatest practice it as if it were a natural language, composing “poems” of aether for the pure beauty of it, rather than practical effects. To mold a casting with pyromancy you must have an emotional level drive to do it (eg, “I need to do this to make money,” is insufficient). Just a hand over your mouth won’t stop your magic, but a proper gag will, and you create an obvious burst of light and heat when casting. Pyromancers have an intuitive grasp of tricks involving heat or flame, and gain a particularly potent trick for augury via communion with a bonfire.

Pyromancy is disadvantaged by wet, cold, or oxygen poor conditions. It works remarkably well with spells that directly create or control heat or flames.
