An oversized black spear the color of an oil slick. It is somehow always awkward to wield, no matter your skill. It is indestructible. With the tiniest motion of will, the blade comes alive, emitting a strange steam; it will eat through magic, harm spiritual entities, and saws the physical to dust. The End of Things brings destruction to much that is otherwise invulnerable, leaving wounds that are highly resistant to *any* and *all* forms of supernatural healing and restoration.
