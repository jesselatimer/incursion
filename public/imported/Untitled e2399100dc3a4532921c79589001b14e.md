Spells:

- You can cast spells that let you step out of yourself. These generate a small spiritual sensor—invisible and intangible—that emulates your mind and senses. If you have lost a sense (eg, been blinded), the sensor retains it, but if you've lacked it since birth, it does not. It is difficult to detect even by the standards of the spiritual, but any spells harmful to spirits instantly destroy it. Its range on initial creation, limit on max range from you while roving, and movement speed all scale with aether. If you are "piloting" the sensor, your body acts as if unoccupied: it can stand upright on its own, but not much else; pain or sufficient alarm will cause you to snap back automatically, the same happens if the sensor is destroyed. The sensor can be trapped by wards, but you can still end the spell and "go back" to your body. With sufficient aether control you can also give the sensor a specific route to follow while you remain active and conscious; the sensor is passive during this trip and can't react in any way; the route must return to you, at which point it gives a condensed sensory summary.
