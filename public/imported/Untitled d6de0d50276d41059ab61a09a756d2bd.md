A palm-sized obsidian slab, Mim can answer almost any question you put to it, as well as any sage. Ask however you want: out loud, writing on its surface, setting it near written questions, or tapping in morse code. It can make noises, display images or text or raise braille on its surface, vibrate in code. You can learn a simple divination trick that conveys question and answer encrypted. Its audio senses lets it act as a directed microphone, and its visual ones as an infrared camera, telescope or microscope. It can receive signals from radio through microwave, but can't broadcast them. It knows the contents of nearly every scholarly or technical work published before you find it, and then some, and can directly absorb the contents of books it is touching. It contains high resolution maps of most of Earth, and uses its senses to keep them updated, or make new ones, as well as find your position. It knows a majority of languages and codes on Earth and can learn to use new ones rapidly. It can do calculations perfectly and rapidly. Its answers synthesize all its knowledge, are clear and cogent, and include awareness of how certain you should be in conclusions reached on limited evidence. For all its capability though, once or twice in years (at least that you could tell), it says something surreal and then never acknowledges it (you don't think Romulus and Remus were raised by dingoes...). As if its information came from a subtly different world.
