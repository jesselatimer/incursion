A piece of crumbling parchment. When you attempt to read it, it crumbles to dust, and you inherently know how to brew the potent magical hallucinogen. Soma can be made from a variety of ingredients, at least one inherently magic and hard to find, but none of them incredibly rare (though rarer and more potent ingredients could make a larger or more puissant batch). Typically brewing demands an hour of active work and a day of simmering, and makes six doses. It can be smoked or consumed, it dissolves in water or oil but has an obvious color and strong flavor. Its effects last about six hours. When taken by a thaumaturge, it increases the rate at which tax heals and slowly improves their capacity, two points around the two hour peak. However, in all partakers it produces euphoric delusions that make it very hard to concentrate on most tasks. Bad trips are rare.
