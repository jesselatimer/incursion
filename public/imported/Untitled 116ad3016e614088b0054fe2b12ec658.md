The eye of a nightmarish beast opens upon you. Afterwards, with shaking, nervous hands, you recreated its dark truth, and now you may share it with others. You gain spells that create a debilitating mental attack.

Inherent: You become very difficult to intimidate or manipulate with fear. You become resistant to this attack specifically, and relatively resistant to other magical fear effects. Staring into your eyes becomes intensely uncomfortable for most people.
