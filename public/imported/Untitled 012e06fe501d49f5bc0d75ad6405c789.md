- You may now actively nudge probabilities towards your desired end. These spells seem to ripple outward through the world, manipulating events in strange and subtle ways to make your desired outcome more likely. Genie rules apply in that the results and its causes may be very different from how you envisioned them. You begin by divining the natural odds, then pressure them towards the ones you want. Aether costs are exponential with the difference between the natural odds and the ones you seek. Spells can be expensive because it's generally unlikely (a snowstorm in Texas in July vs a snowstorm in Norway in December) but also because it's more specific (a person walking into a specific house at a specific time versus any member of a group visiting a city any time in the next year).
