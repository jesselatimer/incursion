You are host to living things beyond counting, and have learned to augment and direct this life towards direct biological manipulation. You may cast spells to incubate magical microbes within yourself; and upon being deployed within living beings, spells to diagnose and alter biological functions.

Inherent: You are healthier. You have a strong intuition for anatomy, biological function, disease, and injury. You gain a rough sense for the general health of microbial ecosystems in living things near you; especially within yourself.
