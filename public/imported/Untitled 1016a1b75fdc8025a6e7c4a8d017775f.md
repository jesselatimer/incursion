For defeating the slavers, you are granted the eternal gratitude of a powerful mythological mount. **Choose one** from this list to gain as an Ally:

### Storm Griffon

A highly intelligent, sapient flying monster with the forebody and wings of a thunderbird and the hindquarters of a lion. It has control over winds and storms. It can communicate telepathically with you. It is noble, fierce, and wise.

### Great Wyrm

A large, flightless reptilian creature related to dragons. Its forelimbs are wings, but it is only capable of gliding. It can breathe fire, tunnel through earth, and while not as intelligent as its more famous cousins, it is capable of actively enhancing and empowering your elemental spells. It is extremely difficult to harm.

### Capricornus

A half-goat, half-fish amphibious creature. Grants you the ability to breathe underwater whenever youâ€™re within five kilometers. It is capable of safely swimming in excess of the speed of sound, and its horns are powerful, indestructible weapons. It can shed its horns at will, and inside you find ambrosia and nectar, capable of nourishing people and healing wounds. The horns grow back in a couple of days.
