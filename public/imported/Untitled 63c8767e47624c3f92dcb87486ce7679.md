The tattered remnant of some otherworldly spirit has intertwined with your soul. You feel echos from it, flashes of insight, often useful but sometimes baffling or disorienting. It pulls a fraction of you into the spirit plane; you can perceive and affect (and be affected by!) spiritual phenomena. Ethereal grace chases your limbs, as you are literally not fully of the physical world: you jump higher and climb faster, move more easily through brush and leave fewer tracks in mud or snow, cut through water and slip out of bindings more easily, and so on. Mortal afflictions lay more lightly on you: infection, poison, temperature, deprivation of sleep, food, or water. But time lays most lightly: you age imperceptibly slowly. Your nature is hard to hideâ€”though physically unchanged, no one will ever mistake you for entirely human.
