An androgynous youth in appearance, Alex is actually far older than you. Though their memories are fractured, they can conjure the decades of knowledge of a talented, educated doctor. On top of that, they possess the most powerful healing thaumaturgy you've ever seen; so powerful, in fact, that it seems likely it has overflowed their body to keep them young and grant them a sort of limited immortality. The fracturing of their memories has left them passive, but kind. With support and time, they will develop a more complete identity.

Thaumaturgy: *Lifeweaving*

Alex draws geomantic aether into spells cast with gestures and flashes of light. They have Talents to perform psychic surgeries, banish infections, and practically reverse aspects of time and entropy for some injuries. They can bring someone back from the dead if they're untaxed, it’s been less than a few hours, and their body has not been destroyed. They can reverse aging for others, about 2–5 years at a time, but just one cast completely taxes them, and a person can only be the subject of this spell approximately once a year.
