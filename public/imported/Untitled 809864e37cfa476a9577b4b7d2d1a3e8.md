You've been approached with a very special offer. You will host and produce a new, thaumaturgy focused reality television show. You are given a key role in scheduling and organizing the show, affording you much flexibility, but you will still need to stay in contact with executives and talent, and be available for the shooting sessions which will probably occupy a large part, but not a majority of your time. But you’ll have a budget, especially for travel and materials, and decent remuneration: a guaranteed salary (approximately 200k USD) as well as some points on gross and licensing (usually at least that again, but the sky’s the limit if you aggressively pursue increasing the show’s revenue, you could rake in millions). Unless you totally abandon it, the Iron Mage series will be beloved, and you’er likely to become personally famous from that alone. You could have a significant effect on public opinion regarding thaumaturges and thaumaturgy; and that’s not to mention the network of influence you could build among the entire thaumaturgical community, but especially its most noteworthy and powerful members. They won’t be your personal army, but less overt power often has much broader effects; as they say, the pen is more powerful than the sword.
