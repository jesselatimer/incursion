- You can cast spells that give you write access to the grisly details of your template. Understand that the spell only gives you access, it doesn't help you make changes or make them intuitive. There is no error checking or backups, so if you make some change that leaves you unable to cast another spell (eg, damaged nerves from extending a limb incorrectly, crippling full body pain from getting metabolic levels incorrect, etc) you will be stuck that way forever. Your template has limits: linear dimension twelve feet; volume: 167,000 cubic centimeters; mass: 218kg. You can expand these limits but it will take a very long time (eg, a century or so of regular work to increase max mass by 100kg).
