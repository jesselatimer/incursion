Your sense of the world is awash with the potential of the Earth itself, a cool mist that caresses your soul. Since the Incursion (perhaps even before, when  we had no way of knowing), the Earth has been wrapped in a complex web of geomantic energy that pools in forests and valleys, flows in currents over mountains and dunes, that surges and ebbs with the tides. You, and others baptised in the Arcane Font, may draw this energy as aether. A given geomantic locale can vary in size, how much aether can pool there, and how fast the aether recovers when drawn from. The more geomantic energy, the more efficient your draw is, and vice versa. Most of the world is awash with energy, and stable enough that Arcane Font is the reference people compare to. The best places thaumaturges have discovered offer three times as much aether for a given draw as is typical (these are rare and secured by an organization). Small locations with low recovery speed can be noticeably drained by intense thaumaturgy use. You are able to sense the flow of geomantic energy, meaning you naturally understand the quality of local energy, as well as that of adjacent regions, and can also tell the direction and strength of any nearby draws via Arcane Font. You sometimes have warning of tectonic activity or storms.
