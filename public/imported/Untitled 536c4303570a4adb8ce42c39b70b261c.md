All roads are one road, and your feet have learned this ur-form. You can never be lost when on any network of paths made by sentient beings (eg, roads, mining tunnels, or animal tracks, but not unaltered cave systems). You have a perfect memory for where and when you’ve walked any such path, and where they are in relation to one another. You have a talent for finding places friendly to travelers, with good prices for grub or a bed. When you’re walking down a road, alone or with boon companions, and are not being actively observed, you may cause the distances between two stretches of road to shrink: in about an hour of walking you can literally go from one side of the world to the other, as long as there are empty stretches of road in each place.
