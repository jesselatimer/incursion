A ten-foot-long metal monstrosity; though if you're far enough away and squint, it looks a bit like the classic witch's besom. It can levitate in place, has no ceiling height (beyond rider ability to survive), it's intuitive to control, turns on a dime, and accelerates hard. Unladen top speed in standard atmosphere is around 320mph. It has room for two passengers if they’re friendly, and a pair of large panniers. It can remove all the unwanted dust from a typical house in one powerful sweep. It magically recognizes its owner and authorized users. It is fed aether via a simple trick, and at full capacity it’s good for about 8 hours of cruising speed. A thaumaturge with average capacity can keep it in the air indefinitely if they don’t cast anything else. It has a magical wind shield for bugs and air pressure, but it has no armor, climate control, or air supply. Its central core, a meter long metal rod, is extremely durable, but the rest is just thin steel. Any thaumaturge with the tools (or crafting magic) and materials can repair or rebuild it from the core.
