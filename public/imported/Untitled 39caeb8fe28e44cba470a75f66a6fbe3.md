You're pretty sure that one's a man and one's a woman, but you can’t consistently tell which. They have mischievous—almost sadistic—personalities, and take pleasure in being inscrutable; which is why you think it’s teasing when they pretend to be annoyed you can’t tell them apart. They are androgynously attractive, and exceptionally graceful. They enjoy dancing and prestidigitation, and know their way around knives and small arms. They don’t like being separated, and will often retreat into their own little world of just the two of them--perhaps a result of having to forge their own way since being orphaned by mysterious circumstances. Maybe they just follow you around to tease you, but they're ready to prove their loyalty too.

Thaumaturgy: Twin Talents, Smoke and Mirrors

They draw geomantic aether and cast via focused will or whispered poems in an alien language. They each have separate eclectic grab bags of tricks such as EM pulse, parachute, paralyzing touch, color object, magic glue, telekinetic lock pick, etc. They can inherently communicate telepathically in line of sight; outside of it they can sense each other's health, distance, and direction. They don't literally share injuries, but feeling the other hurt is distressing. Divinations on or about either will frequently fail, return nothing, or return false data, an inherent property that's stronger when they're close together. They might be able to swap their other Talents, but perhaps they just pretend they can to vex you.

Smoke: One of them can conjure smoke in a range of colors and properties, and can manipulate the shape and flow of any airborne particulates. The conjured smoke can be given several properties. It can block sight, muffle sound, or even hinder divination. It can cling, burn and sting like tear gas, or have a deliriant or soporific effect if inhaled. They can choose who is affected by the smoke, even making it transparent to allies. They can move through smoke, partially becoming part of it and able to squeeze through gaps, though an attack will make them fully physical again.

Mirrors: The other can grant themselves superhuman grace, flexibility, sensitivity, and reaction speed; when unobserved, these enhancements become significantly stronger. As long as they're mobile they can create afterimages that briefly move independently. So long as they and the destination are unobserved, they can teleport short distances. They can conjure gleaming glass knives with mystically potent cutting edges and greatly enhanced throwing velocity.
