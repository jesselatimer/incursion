Spells:

- Brass Skin spells cause physical transformations. They turn your skin and most clothing a burnished brass color. This “brazing” has the following effects:
    - In proportion to the energy you invest in a Brass Skin spell your mass increases, your limbs become stiffer, and you become much more durable. An average amount of aether slows you by ~20%, and makes you completely immune to typical handgun calibers, and very resistant to rifle ones.
    - You (and items affected) become non-flammable, very resistant to heat and to corrosive substances.
    - The brass radiates heat and ignites flammable objects. Your burnished skin resists and can even reflect magic that directly interacts with you.

Sufficient skill allows you to control which is emphasized relative to another, but you can’t separate effects, eg, you can’t become more resistant to corrosion than acid, or reflect magic without burning things. Typical aether expenditure lasts about ten minutes, but each doubling of the duration costs less than double aether.
