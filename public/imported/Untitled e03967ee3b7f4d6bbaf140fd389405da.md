Spells:

- Your spells can cause a massive charge difference anywhere on your body; from a minimum of a weak lightning bolt to a maximum of enough to vaporize a human. Note that you do not gain the ability to make it leap to a target: you need contact or a conductor.
- You can exhale a gale force gust of wind, and make it colder.
- You can cast cloud-walking spells: these allow you to leap from the Earth to the heavens, as long as there are clouds to accept you, and then jog across them or with their motion. You can cover ground rapidly this way.
- Your spells can increase your running speed and jump distance if you're outdoors.
- You can become immune to harm from electricity, immune to wind chill, or and/or greatly insulated from water chill.
