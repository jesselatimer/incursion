Many ancient myths say that living things were originally crafted of clay, soil, or ash. You have realized the literal truth of this matter, the Original Material of Flesh. This understanding allows you to cast spells of healing, golem-craft, and immortality.

Inherent: Your pain tolerance improves dramatically when any of you is touching large bodies of clay, soil, or ash. You gain an intuition for shaping clay. Your own Old Flesh spells work better on you.
