*Baseline*

History is full of shadowy cabals and secret societies, many of them just another way for the already rich and powerful to cement alliances, or tools to let others feel a bit special. This has remained true of Post-Incursion Earth. The addition of magic may have added new tools for secret communication and manipulation of humanity, but most of the worst are limited: all humans have natural resistance to magic that directly transforms them against their will, and no thaumaturgy allows thorough or permanent alteration of the mind any more targeted than mundane drugs and emotional manipulation already could.
