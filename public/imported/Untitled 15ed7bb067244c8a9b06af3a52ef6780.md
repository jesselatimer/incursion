You know a phrase. Speak the phrase in a dark place when the hour chimes and make an offering of your aether, your blood, and a rare and expensive book. Step into a hidden place, slightly apart from the world, and speak to a clotted orb of eyes that has impossible knowledge. It interprets your questions fairly and deeply (aided by its divining power), and gives you a secondary price. Mundane questions have more mundane prices (often just money, or things that can be bought with money). Sometimes the price might be memories, or a service rendered in trade (composing an original song, passing on a message, engaging in bloody violence). You may decide that is too expensive and leave without further cost. If youâ€™re capable of paying the price immediately you can do so and receive your answers. If you are not capable, you may place a hold on the questions, leaving the special space to prepare the payment. While on hold, the knowing one reserves a sliver of Capacity, but you may return to the hidden place again for free to provide payment. The Knowing One does not suffer loitering or deception, and abuse of its realm will incur punishment.
