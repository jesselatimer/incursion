A crystal flask of not-quite-liquid, it smells of fruit, herbs, and, somehow, tears. Consume it, and you will be made flawless. It resonates with your psyche to determine what the optimized you is like (eg, if they’re part of how you prefer yourself, you will retain scars, circumcision, baldness, etc). Every injury, disease, or disorder is gone, and unlikely to return, as your every system and tissue is improved or perfected from immune to muscle to heart to tooth. It may take practice and exercise to bring it out, but in every respect your physical potential will be at or beyond the edge of the homo sapiens body’s performance envelope. It doesn't intrinsically make you more attractive, for instance it doesn’t change your frame or face shape, but your arms and legs are probably longer, you’ll have clear skin and thick, glossy hair. You are practically immune to cancer. You will age as gracefully as a human feasibly could, meaning that absent violence, you are going to live to at least 120.
