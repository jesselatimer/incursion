A Talent is a thaumaturgical aspect that allows you to do things with magic that those without that Talent generally cannot. Unlike tricks, thaumaturges can always intuitively figure out the spells or spells derived from a Talent, with all of their Methods (as permitted by a restricted thaumaturgy).

Possessing a Talent changes you permanently, granting an inherent effect. There is no escaping this, it usually grants a beneficial effect, but sometimes negative or neutral changes. Under “Spells”, specific spells or categories of spells are under each bullet point. Some Talents have multiple levels, these either grant new categories of spell, or improve the ones from previous levels (indicated with a ‘^’ symbol).

Note that while two Thaumaturges may have Talents that are identifiably similar (enough that many names are common to describe them, and to make guesses about a Thaumaturge’s abilities), there are always variations; even the versions that two True Mages get will have differences.

This list is not exhaustive, there are other Talents out there, and as a True Mage you have a chance to acquire a form of them. On the other hand, there are zero guarantees that most of these Talents could be found in the wild.
