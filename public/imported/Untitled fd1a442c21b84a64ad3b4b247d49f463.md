Springing up nearly overnight after the Incursion, Langston and his band have become famous (in certain circles) for the stock of magic and magic adjacent materials they’ve managed to collect. It’s Langston’s catalog you’ll want to peruse if you're looking for drugs to stop up a thaumaturge's conduit or bullets to pierce wards. They offer books ranging from dubious rags to the most respected voices on modern Thaumaturgy. They’re procurers, not makers, so any guarantees are only from their (typically secret) sources, but they’re known for honestly telling you what they know about something and for setting fair prices. While anyone can track down Langston's traveling storefronts, you have a direct line to Langston himself, and get the VIP treatment whenever you care to shop. You get a small discount (5-10%), but more importantly you can put in requests and Langston will do his best to see them filled. He's even willing to take you on as one of his distinguished Reclaimers, should you wish to do a little procuring yourself.
