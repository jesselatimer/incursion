Langston’s company offer a highly sought after service: obtaining and selling magical paraphernalia. They're the best in the business, and do as much as they can keep up with, so they're very choosy about clientele. You're one of the lucky few. Their catalog includes naturally magical materials, drugs that block conduits, bullets that pierce wards, rare books on thaumaturgy or other magic, and much more. And if they don’t have it, they can find it. They can't guarantee everything about what they sell, but they pride themselves on honest information (that won't reveal their trade secrets), and they set fair prices. Because of your contact, they give you a reasonable discount (~10%), and prioritize your requests for procurement.
