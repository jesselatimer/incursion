Black robes over pallid, gray, stitched-together flesh. Though you catch whiffs of formaldehyde, his muscles not only still move, but bulge enough to make it look like he lifts even through his robes. His knowledge of anatomy and biology is incredible, and though he’s not exactly a dab hand at working on the living, he can definitely advise you in exercise and diet better than any living doctor. He’s an absurdly powerful necromancer with hulking rune-scribed bone constructs surrounding him, but who cares about that? His squat form is *flawless*. Jovial, with a strong Welsh accent, he delights in his own incongruity.

Thaumaturgy: *Ministry of Graves*

Rupert draws necrotic aether from places where things have died, and casts spells with short, complicated rites. Though he can simply animate the dead, he prefers to stitch together pieces of multiple dead creatures, preserving them with strange alchemy, and then animate them with runes carved or tattooed into them. His creations are remarkably powerful and durable, with some inherent minor abilities, and both he and they can sap the energy and will from a person by touching them.
