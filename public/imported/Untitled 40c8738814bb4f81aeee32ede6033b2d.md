A dull-metal jug of plain design, with a spring loaded lid, about a half liter in size. It contains an endless supply of an incredibly corrosive gel, generating a half liter an hour. The container is magical, which it must be, because the destructive substance inside cannot otherwise be contained. The gel itself is, somehow, not magical, despite it's ability to turn more than its own mass into hot slag and poisonous vapors. Less than half the jug is enough to reduce a tank to nothing. If it somehow doesn't contact anything, the gel still goes inert after ten minutes outside the jar.
