In a grand ceremony you have been inducted into a particular aristocracy. Paths and ways press upon your senses, a portal from “here” to “there” everywhere you lay your eyes. It is dizzying, but the spells you can call up from those strange maps are worth it. Door Lord lets you cast spells to make doors; first through walls, then to fantastic places.

Inherent: You gain a kind of instinct and memory for doors; you have an impression of where the closest ones are, especially if you’re touching a wall they go through; you’ll never push a pull door or vice versa; you guess right more often than not on whether a door is locked, if the key is nearby you can find it easily, and if it’s electronic lock, you have an impression of where the control is; if you have a key you can tell if the door it goes to is nearby. You can guess much better than chance if somebody is about to come through or just went through a door.
