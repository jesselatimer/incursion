Lola was pulling straight As in MIT’s CSEE program before she dropped out, the Incursion offering unique opportunities. Slender, young, and frequently distracted, it's easy to underestimate the danger she poses, but this pre-Incursion prodigy has flourished in the chaos that magic has wreaked across the technological landscape. She's happy to take on challenges at your behest, and doesn't overly mind if she has to break a few laws to do it. Additionally, she can spare some custom-built electronics for you and your friends, loaded with handcrafted, hardened software and the best hardware money can make. She's financially stable, through coding bounties and selling custom rigs, and doesn't mind loaning some out to a friend in need.

Thaumaturgy: *Technopath*

It’s not clear how much of Lola's intuitive understanding of electronics and computer programs is natural genius versus mystical savantry, but you've seen glowing veins run from her temples to her fingertips when cracking particularly tough encryption. As best as you can tell, she draws aether as a by-product of intense concentration, and casts spells intuitively and silently. She can feel the flow of information and electricity in devices, and can inject code by touching them; she can send an external sense flowing through networks, and can hop across gaps in unexpected ways, such as moving to a device she can see from a digital camera. The Incursion has changed the way the Internet functions, and Lola will not go unchallenged in her mystical mastery of 1s and 0s, but she's among the best of the best at what she does.
