Time is quite literally on your side. The hand of entropy lies more lightly on you and your possessions, so you’ll age more slowly, your goods rust and your food spoil less. You have a precise sense of what time it is, and how much time passes between events; and yet, time flies a bit less quickly when you’re having fun, or seems to tick faster when you’re bored and waiting. You never forget a properly scheduled appointment, and with just a little effort, assuming no outside interventions, you always arrive precisely on time. You move and think just a touch faster than everyone else, and however you travel—by foot, magic, plane, or whatever—it seems to go as fast and smoothly as possible, if not more so. When others might panic, you have a bit more mental breathing room; and when your life is truly in danger, you can react so quickly it seems precognitive to those around you. Be warned, time may change its speed and weight for you, but it shall never sway in its direction.
