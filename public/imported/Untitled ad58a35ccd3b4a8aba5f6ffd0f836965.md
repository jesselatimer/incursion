This animal's shoulders are even with a tall man’s waist, her ghostly coat seems to fade into the background, and her eyes burn with ghostly blue fire. But whenever that would attract undue attention, she abruptly looks like a slightly derpy Husky. You're pretty sure she doesn't actually understand language, yet she’s fully cognizant of circumstances, anticipating and planning where even some humans fail. She doesn't seem to mind learning and performing tricks, and will answer to any name you choose to give her.

Natural Power: *The Goodest Girl*

She is supernaturally strong, fast, and sturdy, and can become more so by drawing from some inner well of energy. When enhanced, her coat is bullet proof and chameleonic, her bite is armor-piercing and stone-crushing, and can harm spiritual enemies. Her senses are not only as keen as you'd expect from a wolf, but she can obviously perceive spirits, track things in a way that's supernatural, and has a precognitive danger sense. She has magical barks and howls: they can be heard clearly far away and through barriers; convey impressions like "Danger, run!" "This way to safety!" and similar; rouse people even from drugged stupor and magical effects; and even induce supernatural fear that can paralyze or panic.
