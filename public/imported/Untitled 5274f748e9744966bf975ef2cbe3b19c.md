For reasons that aren’t clear to you, you’ve been granted a permanent scholarship for the correspondence program of the world's foremost college of magic, good for two classes a term (there are three terms per year) for at least hundreds of years. You receive the course catalog a week in advance, along with a letter containing academic counseling, as well as any diplomas or certifications you’ve earned. You may sign up for up to two additional classes, but the tuition is… dramatic. There’s no need for postage, or even maintaining a standard address or PO box. You can leave your homework under a rock, and so long as you’ve attached the correct sigil your instructors will receive it. In return, your coursework will arrive via the depressingly mundane means of couriers that somehow know how to reach you. Though their main attraction is their various magical programs, their science, math, and humanities programs are all excellent and, somehow, accredited.
