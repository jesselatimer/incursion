Why do you have an extended scholarship to the world's foremost distance education school of magic (self-proclaimed)? Who knows! But you do! However shady they may seem, the Invisible College is paramount when it comes to training aether control, teaching tricks, and information about magical phenomena. They also have highly effective (and somehow, accredited) mundane courses that benefit from magic to optimize your education: expect to learn up to twice as fast as usual. Their rapid language acquisition courses *guarantee* conversational ability in one year. You get eight (8) free credits each year (about half of a standard course load), plus expenses, for one three-hundred twenty one (321) years, starting today. Extra credits are 4000USD per. If you still exist, you receive their correspondence (catalog, academic advisory, course materials, certifications). By regular mail if possible, by any means necessary if you're, eg, sunk in a box in the bottom of the sea. Scribble the correct sigil on your return mail, put it somewhere you can't see, and the college will receive it.
