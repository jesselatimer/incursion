Infuriatingly enigmatic and cryptic. Utterly creepy. An irritatingly high pitched voice. She shows up in impossible places, and no one else ever seems to see her. You'd believe that she's a hallucination, yet... she offers insight. Sometimes you catch sight of her, running, or turning at the corner at the edge of your vision, you chase her and have a "chance" encounter, with an enemy or ally, that changes the course of your life. Sometimes you hear her whispering, cryptic hints, rumors of plots unfolding on the other side of the world, questions you never thought to ask; everything you've made sense of has been true and useful. Sometimes she's just there, staring, and as your nerves go on edge you realize danger has come to claim you, and her warning made the difference. It's clear that she offers knowledge you couldn't get any other way, and you wonder what sort of price you may need to pay.
