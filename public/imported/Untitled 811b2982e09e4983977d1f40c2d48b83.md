Spells:

- You can cast powerful diagnostic spells at close range, giving you extremely detailed impressions of someone's body and health. But be aware that while more powerful and nuanced than an MRI or other technology, these impressions can be difficult to interpret fully without medical knowledge.
- You gain short range spells to encourage or discourage health; bolster or undermine the immune system; relieve or induce pain or stiffness; sedate or arouse; induce euphoria or stimulation; and much more. A baseline is that you can do much of what over-the-counter drugs could do, but better, faster, and with fewer side effects. However, you don't directly control flesh. You can improve or diminish an organ's function, but can't make it wither; you can't reknit the flesh of a wound, but you can make it heal as fast and thoroughly as humanly possible.
