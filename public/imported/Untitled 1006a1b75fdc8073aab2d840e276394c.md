This entity or essence is the antithesis of the power behind the unspeakable rituals, and has entrusted you with some portion of its knowledge. You know the rituals of the Unaussprechlichen Kulten (though you cannot perform them yourself), and you learn rituals of your own that can be used to counter their power. The Namer will re-teach you these rituals if it senses you have forgotten them. Beware, these confer no resistances to magic other than that from the unspeakable rituals, even that with similar effects. You learn:

- A cloaking ritual that renders you difficult to perceive via Guidance.
- A memory-enforcing ritual that hardens your mind to alteration; and another to repair your memories should they be changed. Both versions make you aware of the specific nature of the memory alteration.
- A sensing ritual that can reveal nearby creatures that have been created or altered by the cult.
