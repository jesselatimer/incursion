    'A standardized unit of aether named for an ancient Greek sorceress. The smallest amount of aether necessary for a thaumaturge to affect the world. Typical usage is in kilocirces (kC) or megacirces (mC).',
  conduit:
    "A thaumaturge's means of accessing aether through a Source. Commonly thought of as a pipe that one draws magic through, with Endurance setting the initial diameter of this conduit and tax reducing it. It is slightly more accurate to say the conduit is the muscle one flexes to work magic, with Endurance determining endurance and tax acting as lactic build-up and glucose depletion.",

    "A tax that persists as long as the associated magical effect does. Effectively lowers one's maximum available Endurance.",

  Power:
    'If casting magic is like flexing a muscle, Power represents fast-twitch strength, the amount of force a thaumaturge can bring to bear in a single casting. Just as a stronger person requires less effort to lift a given weight, more Power improves the efficiency of drawing aether, decreasing the amount of tax incurred for using a given amount.',
  Endurance:
    "Endurance represents a thaumaturge's magical endurance. Or, if casting magic is like flexing a muscle, some combination of slow-twitch strength and cardiovascular health. Specific mechanics vary by Source.",
  Source:
    "A means by which a thaumaturge draws aether. A part of one's magical essence that acts as an interface with specific flavors of aether. e.g. Arcane Font, Necrophage, etc.",
  Method:
    'A means by which a thaumaturge transforms aether into spells. e.g. Pyromancer, Wizard, etc..',
  Talent:
    "A magical aspect intrinsic to a person's thaumaturgy that allows them to cast a specific kind of magic that those without the Talent cannot. e.g. Sortition, Master of Death.",
  Bond: 'An advantageous mystical connection with a person, power, thing, or organization.',
  Ally: 'An individual practically fated to be a boon companion and ally.',
  Contact:
    'An especially favorably disposed organization, person, or power; lacking the greater loyalty of an Ally.',
