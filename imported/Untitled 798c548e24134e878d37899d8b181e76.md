- ^ When you alter the properties of an object, you can now impose a magical geas upon it, granting it new, aetherically-fueled purpose. These often take the form of words or short phrases, with more nuance possible as control increases. These geases reserve a proportional amount of aether, and can only be removed when the object is nearby.
    
    For example:
    
    - Manacles given the purpose "Restrain" will do so more effectively than iron chain and lock would normally allow: perhaps weakening magical attempts to break free, growing in size and strength in response to physical attempts to break free, and/or dynamically reshaping tumblers in response to lockpicks.
    - A sword given the purpose "Cut" will do so with supernatural ease, but may accomplish it in any number of ways: the edge may remain sharp no matter how much it's used or the edge may appear dull but still cut like a razor. In any case, it will be more likely to cut everything and anything--accidents from use of the weapon would almost certainly increase.
    - [perhaps more examples]
- [where do we fit in things like burning swords??] Your spells may do more than just enhancing properties, but may now take properties of one thing and embed them in another. You could place a gas stove's flaming quality into a sword, or the soothing comfort of hot chocolate into a robe.
