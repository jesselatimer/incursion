Spells:

- The spells of this talent temporarily transmute your body; your skin will become either sleek like a dolphin’s or slimy like a frog’s, and change color to something appropriate for camouflage in whatever natural body of water is nearby, as well adapt you to its temperature. Your appearance is always unsettling to mundane humans. You adapt to be able to see, hear, and smell better underwater, and you will also be able to store hours worth of oxygen in your body. Being out of water will become painful, cripplingly so in low humidity. You can also aim for other features, with more aether to make them stronger, and more control making it more likely for you to get what you want:
    - You can become more amphibious, able to exit the water without significant difficulty.
    - Pressure adaptation, allowing you to dive deeper than any human, and with no decompression issues.
    - Shark-like skin, nearly armored with rasps of bone, or thicker slime that can seal small wounds automatically.
    - Improved swimming ability, including a preternatural instinct for swimming and aquabatics, as well as webbing between your fingers and lengthened toes.
    - Huge lambent yellow eyes that let you see clearly in the dark and murk.
    - A growth on your forehead gives you passive and active underwater sonar.
    - Other enhanced senses, including electrosensitivity, or shark like smell.
    - The ability to just somehow go completely without oxygen.
    - A throat a bit like a frog’s that lets you can suck in water and spit it out with lethal force.
    - Enhancing… something makes your visage go past unsettling into supernaturally, viscerally disturbing, this can cause people to panic, faint, and even to have active memory issues.
