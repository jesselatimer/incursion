Spells:

- You can cast divination spells with effects like your death sense, but more accurate, with more information, and at longer ranges. You may also cast a spell that passively enhances your death sense for a time.
- You can cast spells that render you and the spiritual realm tangible to each other (even aspects of it that aren't death-related). You may touch or strike spirits, but also they affect you, though some types of spiritual attack are ineffective when physical instead.
- You can cast a spell that directly harms death related spiritual beings or the animated dead.
- You can lay compulsions on the undead; depending on your skill, aether, and the power of the undead being, you can freeze them in their tracks, compel them to answer questions or to move away, up to placing a geas on them, or even enthralling a mindless one.
- Your spells can generate a temporary pseudo-ghost from a death site or piece of a dead thing. It is not a true spirit, but can recall pieces of information about their life. You cannot compel truth or accuracy, but the dead have no more ego, and thus less reason for dishonesty or antagonism.
- By handling or even consuming some of a dead body you can gain knowledge more directly. Particularly you can “feel” things that happened around the corpse, but you can also gain insight from their life, and with sufficient aether control you may temporarily extract a skill a dead thing knew well.
