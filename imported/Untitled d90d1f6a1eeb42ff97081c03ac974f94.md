Spells:

- Your spells may revert the state of your body, or part of your body, to that of some seconds ago. Most thaumaturges can reliably revert up to 5 seconds, but with sufficient control and aether, up to 20 seconds is feasible. Reversion normally does not change your position, but with sufficient control and aether, it can also revert your position in space (ie, teleport to where you were at the time of reversion), though even a bad failure won't, eg, ignore the rotation of the Earth and move you into a mountain. Your spells normally preserve your mind and memory, but you may choose to revert them instead. Your spirit and your conduit cannot be reverted. This spell is extremely rapid to cast but heavily taxing.
- Your may blink forward in time, completely avoiding an attack, for as little as a hundredth of a second or for up to 5 seconds. You re-enter time in the same place and state you were in when you left. This spell is extremely rapid but heavily taxing.
- You can move forward in time faster than the mundane universe, slowing your own time frame by a factor of up to twenty. Be careful as this doesn't offer any protection against people harming you as they go by in a blink to you; but will let you get to the future faster.
