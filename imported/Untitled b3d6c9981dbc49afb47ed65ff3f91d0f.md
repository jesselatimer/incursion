You speak the secret language of fire and flame uttered by the incandescent soul. Pyromancers forge magic with the internal fire of their passion and release it by the gates of their mouths. Burning conviction and voluble emotion fuels the best pyromancers; and the greatest practice it as if it were a natural language, composing “poems” of aether for the pure beauty of it, rather than practical effects. You cannot use pyromancy to do something you don’t directly believe in on an emotional level (“I need to finish this job so I can eat,” is insufficient). Pyromancers do not need to move or physically speak to cast, but do create an obvious burst of light and heat. Pyromancers have an intuitive grasp of tricks involving heat or flame, including keeping themselves at a comfortable temperature, and gain a particularly potent trick for divination by communing with flame.

Pyromancy is disadvantaged by wet, cold, or oxygen poor conditions. It works remarkably well with spells that directly create or control heat or flames.
