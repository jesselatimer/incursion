You've formed a symbiotic relationship with a swarm of small spirits that subsist on "violent intent". They swarm continuously in your proximity, hoping an attack will get close enough to you that they can devour as much of the intent in it as they can—which coincidentally reduces the attack's potential to harm. Magical blasts become hot air, bullets hit no harder than hail, chemical weapons go suddenly inert, and bats or knives feel as if thickly padded. They cannot eat your violent intent. Their buzzing can warn you when a sentient thing desires to harm you. Certain attacks might be so fast or powerful that they can't eat all of its intent in time to negate it before it hits you; their appetite also has limits, and once full need hours to digest. However, more to eat means they thrive, increasing their speed, raising their capacity; but the larger the swarm, the more they need to eat before they dwindle and their capacity reduces. One year of peace puts them in complete hibernation, and you will go unprotected until sufficient ill will rouses them from torpor. It is the intent they devour, the sentient will to cause harm. It doesn't have to be directed at you specifically, but it does have to be there. So while they can feed on a trap or a bomb, they cannot feed on—and thus do not protect you from—eg, acts of nature, accidents, or sparring.
