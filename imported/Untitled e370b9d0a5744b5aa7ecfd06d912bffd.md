The thaumic contamination is accumulating quickly, and is growing faster than current attempts to contain it. The world is nearing critical condition, and will shortly reach the point of civilizational collapse--even *the most optimistic projections* give us only a few decades at current rates. Clean casting is well-known, but costs ~25% more time and aether. Many population centers are rife with contamination, and unclean magic cast there regularly provokes consequences. The contamination has left large swathes of innocents sick, scared, hungry, and haunted. Yet still, most mages are unwilling to handicap themselves with clean casting while their rivals are unfettered.

Some symptoms and effects of the contamination:

- Mages and those living in contaminated areas have significantly higher rates of cancer and mental disorders across the board, particularly paranoia. These insidious diseases work their way past most protections.
- The natural world is failing. Plants are increasingly blighted, and many beneficial magical beings have started to flee or die.
- Blight spectres manifest in places of high stress and high magic. They are something like ghosts given ectoplasmic substance by contamination. Their power and density varies; many are simply frightening; but some can be much stronger or demonstrate Talents often associated with ghosts, such as psychokinesis, possession, or psychological attack.
- Resentment against mages is simmering, and beginning to build to a boil. They are resistant to explanations about contamination and clean casting, so doing magic in public, clean or not, may result in torches and pitchforks.

*Boon*

You start out knowing the techniques to cast magic safely, and have already overcome the skill penalty (but not the efficiency one).

- You gain X Foundation Points.
- You gain the Artifact:

### Purity Rod

This short, slender octagonal rod of an indefinable color makes you immune to the contamination as long as it’s on your person, allowing you to cast with no efficiency penalty while remaining clean. The Purity Rod has chosen you as an agent of cleansing strength; if you abandon this calling, it will leave you for another.

- Octarine Peace is a pleasant non-governmental organization staffed by passionate and/or intelligent people. You may choose to work with Octarine Peace, either directly or indirectly, against this common foe. Octarine Peace will aid you in your efforts as much as they are able; and will accept help with both outreach and cleansing contamination.

*Victory*

You win by reaching a “worldwide sub-critical” status on Thaumic Contamination. This requires some combination of 90–98% of all practicing thaumaturges to be using clean techniques, and 90–98% of land thoroughly cleaned. The exact speed you can do this varies, but expect it to realistically take *at least* a decade of dedicated efforts.

- Octarine Peace does not shut down operations just because their primary mission is done, and they continue to fight against magical disasters everywhere. Though initially unappreciated, they have grown to become lauded heroes of the modern magical world. Your early association with the organization gives you increasing cachet, as well as direct rewards: assistants, access to secret magical lore, honorariums and stipends, and more.
- The Purity Rod transforms into a new Artifact:

### Meridian

A permanent and unforgeable identifier stamped upon your spirit. The Meridian confers the full benefits of the Purity Rod, removing the efficiency penalty for casting cleanly. It additionally marks you as an elite mage, instrumental to the cleansing of the world. The Meridian is manifested visually as a series of shining points of light in a unique pattern through your skin. You can suppress this effect with a thought, but the Meridian wants to shine.

- The world materially thanks you for your efforts: choose an additional Artifact from the list.
