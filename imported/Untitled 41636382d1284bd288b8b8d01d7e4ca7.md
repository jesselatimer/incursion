Time is on your side. Take this literally. The hand of entropy lies more lightly on you and your possessions (you and your companions age more slowly, your things rot or rust less, etc). You always know exactly what time it is, and can track time precisely between events. You never forget a properly scheduled appointment, and have an uncanny talent to arrive precisely on time. Travel in general seems to go as smoothly and quickly as possible. You think and move just a touch faster than others do; others might swear your reactions are precognitive. Opposite to most of humanity's experience, time contracts when you're bored, and expands when you're having fun.
