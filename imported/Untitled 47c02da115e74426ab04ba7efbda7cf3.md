Delirious insight has cracked your mind open to the incomprehensible shadow of the world. You can draw aether from this strange unreality, and you always draw as if you were at full Power, ie, it is *never affected by tax* (though it is by reservation)*.* But every draw from it you place yourself and the world at risk. The more taxed you are and the more aether you’re drawing, the greater the chance that a phantasm will tear into the world. These things are as incomprehensible as their source, and when they prey upon a sapient creature, their victim’s mind is cruelly bent and warped. There is no known way to ward against or uproot phantasms; they are not typical magical phenomena, You can choose to take them on yourself, or expel them. If expelled, they usually affect more people (up to a dozen), but at reduced strength. They do not choose their targets based on physical proximity (they can affect those miles away or more), and more often than chance they seem to choose people that will make the most trouble for you. Thankfully the phantasms’ direct effects are temporary (lasting from hours to months based on strength), but  the depression, delusions, psychosis, paranoia, psychosomatic pains, compulsive violence and other effects they cause can leave lasting trauma. Beware: when afflicting others, *you* are most often the subject or target of these derangements.

*The hands of all good men are turned against the Oath Breaker.*
