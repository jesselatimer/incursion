Spells:

- Spells from this talent enhance the sensitivity and dexterity of your hands to fully supernatural levels; whenever it does, your hands turn faintly red. The combination allows you to get an accurate sense of somethingâ€™s shape and construction just by touching it, even indirectly. Reading written text by feeling the grooves in the paper is trivial, and you have a chance to read printed text by feeling the bumps of the ink. You practically have X-ray vision into a lock while picking it. You can touch the floor to feel micro-impressions that might let you track a person who recently walked barefoot across a wooden floor. By touching a floor or wall you can tell where, within the meter, anyone inside a house is moving. You can tell temperature better than advanced laboratory instruments. Your control over your hands while this spell is active transcends nerves and muscles. You can replicate a picture or writing with microscopic precision, and if you know the basics of music you can mimic any virtuoso performance. Such sensitivity is painful though, and any actual injury to your hands while these spells are active will probably make you pass out. A typical aether expenditure grants ten minutes of the full spectrum enhancement; but you can cast a spell for a specific task, such as one act of lockpicking, forgery, or sensing.
