In the mundane world, shadow is merely a name for those spaces where light doesn't fall. For you, however, shadow is a substance, and its whisps cling to your fingers with a cool and inviting temperature. This Talent lets you create threads, shrouds, and nets of shadow that can be used for a variety of purposes.

Inherent: You have better dark vision, and are always aware when light is falling on some part of you.
