A sapient spirit has chosen you to be its master and friend; and you agreed to a bond. This bond is more intimate than most, a splice to the very root of your soul. You will never be parted, and find the thought repugnant. You are always aware of what the other is experiencing and thinking. It is as intelligent as you. Though you do not share a mind exactly, your close mental bond makes shared intellectual pursuits very efficient--and since it knows your mind, it can alert you if either of you have been tampered with. It can act externally from you, but the mind link fades with distance--becoming simple telepathy at about 50 meters, fading into empathy, and finally no connection at all after 5 kilometers. It can cast most tricks you know, and shares your Source and conduit, with a Method that reflects its own essential nature. While near, it can aid in your concentration and efficiency with spells, especially for spells that take a long time to cast. It can take any shape like a living creature from the size of a mouse to a large house cat, but has a preferred form. It can be hurt, and if damaged sufficiently will be temporarily banished, though it will always return to your side with the setting or rising of the sun.
