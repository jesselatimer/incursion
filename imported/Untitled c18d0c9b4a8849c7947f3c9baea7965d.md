A spirit has chosen you as its master and friend; with your agreement, a sacred ritual has spliced it to the root of your soul. It is as intelligent as you are, and in your Presence you share thoughts and experiences. Your shared independent points of view helps with many things: you will learn rapidly and more deeply; and be resistant both to mundane and supernatural mental and emotional manipulation. If someone does succeed in tampering with you, it can alert you or make outside attempts to help. Outside of your presence, the link fades first to simple telepathy, then to ever vaguer impressions, until at a hundred miles apart you only have a general sense of direction. It can use your conduit and Source(s) to draw aether, which it molds with its own efficient Method into any tricks it has learned. When in your Presence it can be the point of origin for your own magic effects.  It has a physical embodiment that it requires to function, though it has no need for food, water, or air. It does need to sleep but only for a few hours at a time. It can change its from to any plausible living thing between 1oz and 60lbs until it sleeps, and can turn invisible and/or intangible for a few minutes at a time. and physically harmed, and if sufficiently damaged will be temporarily banished. It can also be trapped by appropriate wards, but can banish itself at will. So long as you live it will return to your side with the setting or rising of the sun.
