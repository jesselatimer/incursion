Spells:

- You can cast spells that create wards: sheets of aether that can protect against various magical, spiritual, or physical attacks. You can anchor a ward over a place or object through a physical token: a rune, lodestone, or similar. Wards can be cast quickly at the expense of longevity and strength, but are more effective if you take your time. Temporary wards can be cast through standard means, but will weaken as they use up their aetheric pool. Wards can be made more permanent and can regenerate if cast carefully while reserving a portion of your conduit. Strength and control both contribute to the effectiveness and durability of a ward, as does the stability of the anchor. Wards can be either one-sided or two-sided, and may be inverted to create a prison. You do not have much subtlety at this level: wards stop gross magical attacks or gross physical attacks, but not both, and cannot stop subtler magics (eg, mind or spirit affecting spells, such as those from Keter or Sortition). However, wards can absorb a lot of force before failing, with a few caveats: a direct hit from a Sword of the Art will destroy weak wards, though stronger weaves may absorb multiple blows; anti-magic effects may unravel wards in time; and anyone with unblocked access to a ward's anchor may destroy it to unravel the ward. All of these weaknesses can be mitigated with sufficient investments of aether, time, and control: the skill ceiling for Warp and Weft is extremely high.
