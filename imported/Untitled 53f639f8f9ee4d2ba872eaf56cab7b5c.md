- You may now create glassy looking doors that appear free-standing in mid-air and open to a dim and ghostly space known as “the Backside of the World,” as well as doors from the backside to the front. These doors cease to exist as soon as you close them. Only those with specialized supernatural senses or magic can even perceive someone in the backside from the frontside, and it is a rare magic (other than another Door Lord) that can cause harm from one side to the other. You can only access a small area of the Backside around your entry point: as you move away, it gets even darker, and harder to think and breathe, and more expensive to make an exit door. An average expenditure gives you ten meters, twenty to thirty if you push. This range shrinks by about half every two hours, though a recast can expand it again without having to open a new door.
