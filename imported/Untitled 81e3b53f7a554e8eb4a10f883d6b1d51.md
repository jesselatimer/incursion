Against all reason, a large, ornate wooden armoire is following you, radiating goodwill and cheer. Most of the time it simply appears where it needs to be, but it is animated and can twist and hop about if necessary. Any time you check into a hotel or enter a guest room it just seems to already be there. It is supernaturally durable, and in the case it is damaged, seems to get repair work done when you're not looking at it. It cannot directly communicate, but somehow you always know its feelings. It's friendly by nature, but if push comes to shove it *will* fall over on somebody trying to hurt you or your friends, and this *always* ends badly for the subject.

Thaumaturgy(?): *Convenient Spaces*

Though obviously magically animated, it also has other powers that seem like they might be limited by a conduit. These include its ability to be where you need it, and to curiously slip the notice of people who should be paying attention. It can transfer inanimate items between its interior and a secure extra dimensional warehouse. It can clean, repair and preserve them. It can also manifest things just the thing you need when you open it, whether you knew it or not. A perfectly tailored costume, a stockpile of ammunition, an air tank, freshly prepared food, or—in a nasty enough emergency—a portal to a safe and empty space. You know without it saying that there are limits to what it produces.
