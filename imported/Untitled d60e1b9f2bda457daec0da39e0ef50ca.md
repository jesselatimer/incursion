A twisted black bottle. To uncork it you must identify a victim, which allows the exit of a vile spirit that will seek out and slay the target. With a potent enough identifier (eg, a “true name”, a piece of their body, an aura photograph, etc) it can hunt that target anywhere in the world, and somewhat beyond. It exists purely on the spirit plane, making it invisible and intangible save to those with appropriate magic. It is indefatigable, hunting its target night and day, flying at about 20mph. It expends its essence to kills by touch, spreading nigh-irresistable poison and corruption, physical and spiritual; so it avoids contact with the living unless necessary to reach its prey. The bottle regenerates the spirit with death, suffering and decay from around the world; normally it refills in about a year, but up to twice as fast during an atrocious war or pandemic.
