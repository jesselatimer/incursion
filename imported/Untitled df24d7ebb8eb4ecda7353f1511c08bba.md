A ten-foot-long monstrosity that looks less like the classic witch’s besom, and more like somebody made a vacuum out of a Harley. But mount up, supply it with aether, and off you’ll go. Top speed in standard atmosphere, with a single rider, is around 320mph. It has room for two passengers if they’re really friendly, and a pair of panniers. It is fed aether via a simple trick, and at full capacity it’s good for about 8 hours of flight. A thaumaturge with average capacity can probably keep it in the air indefinitely if they don’t need to cast other spells. It has a magical wind shield for bugs and air pressure, but it has no armor, climate control, or air supply. Its central core is extremely durable, but the rest is standard for its materials (mostly relatively thin steel); if it’s damaged, appropriate materials and some knowledge of magic allows one to repair it, or even rebuild it from the core out. Finally, it can remove all the unwanted dust from an entire room in one sweep.
