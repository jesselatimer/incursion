Germaine is a wizard of the table (both figuratively and literally). He began by seeking out the many strange new creatures and plants the Incursion offered, to explore their culinary potential. On the way, he discovered that he literally gains magical power by consuming specially-prepared magical flora and fauna. He carries an adamantium wok (indestructible, a barrier against some magic, nonstick with flawless heat distribution) and orichalcum knives (can cut through nearly anything, even some sprits and magic). When threatened by supernatural foes, he doesn’t hesitate to begin prepping them while they’re still moving around. He’s a massive, boisterous man, and loves to make food for people as often as he can.

Thaumaturgy: *Mighty Metabolism*

Germaine can transform the natural magic in creatures he has consumed into permanent enhancements and spells. He draws aether from an internal well, and casts magic in whatever fashion the source of his power did. When you meet him, Germaine is supernaturally strong and durable, and he also has a handful of other useful tricks: he is nearly immune to heat, has better than human eyesight, and can spit a binding mucus. He can also prepare small meals for himself that restore his injuries and slightly reduce his tax.
