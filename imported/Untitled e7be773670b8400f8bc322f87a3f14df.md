A permanent and unforgeable identifier stamped upon your spirit. The Meridian confers the full benefits of the Purity Rod, removing the efficiency penalty for casting cleanly. It additionally marks you as an elite mage, instrumental to the cleansing of the world. The Meridian is manifested visually as a series of shining points of light in a unique pattern through your skin. You can suppress this effect with a thought, but the Meridian wants to shine.
