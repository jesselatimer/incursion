You have aligned your breath with the cosmic energy of the universe. You carry within you an intrinsic pool of qi, which you may convert to aether. Its size is determined by Capacity according to this rule of thumb: if your Power were equal to your Capacity, the pool contains as many circes as one absolute maximum draw from Arcane Font. Drawing from your pool *never* causes tax, however, if you are ever overtaxed (ie, by other Sources), your pool will hemorrhage its qi and can’t be refilled until you recover. The pool refills steadily, proportional to your tax: if you’re untaxed it’s about two days. Meditation can help but cosmic energy only flows so fast. Holding qi within you is beneficial to your physical and mental health and strength. Most users feel their intuition subtly boosted. By meditating and moving your qi while touching someone you can promote their health.
