A tattered remnant of an immortal from the Incursion has fused to your soul. The fusion could, theoretically, be undone, but until then you exist partly on the spirit plane. You’re occasionally given flashes of insight, often useful, sometimes disorienting or baffling, but given freely and in good faith. You age imperceptibly slowly, and need never fear death by old age. You possess a grace that is literally not of this world, as if you are less affected by mortal restrictions; e.g. you jump higher, climb more easily, are less impeded by and leave fewer tracks in snow, mud, underbrush and the like; you are difficult to restrain with mortal bonds. You're more resistant (but not immune) to mortal harms like disease or poison, to extremes of temperature, sunburns, or deprivation of food, water. You need about a third less sleep than before, and waken immediately to signs of danger. Your new grace is hard to hide—though physically unchanged, no one looking upon you would mistake you for entirely human.
