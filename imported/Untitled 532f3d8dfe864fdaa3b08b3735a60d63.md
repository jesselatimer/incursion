You have come to understand the truth, that before a sober, steady conviction, reality will yield. Psychics cast directly with their mind. Deep self-awareness and a stable mental center improve the clarity with which you perceive your mental tools for manipulating aether, but plain strength of will can also push through. Psychics improve their practice through meditation, visualization exercises, psychological self-analysis, and similar methods. Psychic practice requires no movement or sound, but at the limits of your control there may be side-effects, such as a faint glow at the temples or fingertips, bulging forehead veins, a sourceless ringing noise, or an ominous feeling in people nearby. Emotional turmoil and distress, as well as many drugs will reduce your ability to manipulate aether; traumatic experiences may render you unable to use the Psychic powers for a time. Psychics know when a nearby mind is paying specific attention to them. Psychics can intuitively perform short-ranged telekinesis, clairsensory, and mental communication tricks.

Compared to other Methods, Psychics have better control when using small amounts of aether, but large volumes diminish control faster. Psychics get a fairly mild advantage to mind affecting and informational magic, and a moderate disadvantage to magic that transforms matter (e.g. Skinchanger, Natural Philosopher, Brass Skin, Call of the Deep, Old Flesh, etc, but not Dark Smoke or Steel Step, which only manipulate it).
