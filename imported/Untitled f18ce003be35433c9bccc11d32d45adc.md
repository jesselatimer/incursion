Spells:

- Your spells can bolster your stamina: your muscles might still burn, but you’ll be able to continue moving your limbs with all signs of vigor as long as your spell lasts. This stamina can be specialized for a single activity (eg, running one double ultra marathon, cutting down a specific number of trees, etc), to improve efficiency.
- You can cast spells that let you increase your momentum and durability as long as you’re moving under your own power; essentially rendering you a nearly unstoppable juggernaut (as per usual, more efficient for a single specific charge, rather than a duration). Combined with stamina enhancement you could run for hours.
- You can improve your “carrying capacity”, making you stronger but only for the purpose of hauling or dragging something, and also improving your foot to ground traction.
- Your spells can deaden your sense of pain. Have a care: pain exists for a reason.
- Your spells can decrease and delay your need for sleep. A typical casting lets you push for about eight hours; but the more sleep debt you’re pushing through the more likely the spell is to fail, most mages can manage seventy two hours without sleep, after which they’ll need at least 12 hours rest.
