Her name is unpronounceable, her appearance bizarre, but she wants nothing more than to experience all the world has to offer. Sssszzhss’Vzsslssssxvs (Sashy, for short), likes her natural form—a blue blob covered in tendrils—but spends a lot of time mimicking humans or animals to blend in. Things she's said imply that there's an entire tribe of beings like her, and they want her to return to the fold, but she'd prefer not to talk about it, thank you very much. One minute mature, the next full of childlike wonder, she comes across as sheltered.

Natural Power: *Metabiology*

Metamorphs are very hard to harm, as they have no blood or discrete organs; she can digest nearly anything, including gas and wood, and drink salt water. She's also stronger than the average human, and she can dissolve things she touches, turning it into dust or sludge. Their magical biology allows them to rapidly shift between a variety of forms, mimicking nearly any conceivable living creature ranging from 80 to 700lbs. This is both biologically and magically taxing, more so for higher weight and more thorough disguises. She can look like a slimegirl 24 hours a day, no problem, but for anything else must take daily breaks. On the other hand, her deep disguises are supernaturally effective, fooling even X-rays or divination. Pieces of her separated from her core turn to dust.
