At certain moments there’s a hammering in your head, a pounding in your ears, you feel your bones rattling with their heavy power and your blood whistles through your body like live steam. Ferroequus allows you to cast spells with a variety of effects—either together or separately—that make you more like a train.

Inherent: Your heart is as healthy as a human’s can be, as steady as a metronome. You have a little extra momentum when moving under your own power: bump into a person and they’re almost always the one staggered, doors are rocked off their hinges when you charge through them, etc. Finally, there’s a little extra pressure behind your determination: when you make up your mind, it’s harder to change—whether that’s “I’ll never betray my comrades,” or “I’m going to do this incredibly dumb and risky thing.”
