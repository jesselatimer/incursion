- You know a spell that will permanently revert your body to the true old flesh. Upon successful casting of the spell, you become one of the Unfired (see below). This fails if you are Stilled or Preserved.

### *The Unfired*

The body of an Unfired one is made of the primal ur-flesh, a kind of divine clay. To begin with, they look little different than they did as a human, only more "earth toned".

Internally, though, bone, blood, sinew and viscera all half-way melded. They are about 20% denser than contemporary flesh, and are pound for pound stronger, though not faster. That is, their peak speed of muscle contraction is the same as a mundane humans, but they achieve that with more weight.

The unfired flesh is intrinsically more durable, but also less volatile than a human's: a removed limb or organ will remain viable for direct reattachment for days.

Additionally: blood loss or internal bleeding are irrelevant; their organs, including muscle and bone, fail only briefly before their body rearranges; temperature extremes fatal to a human merely make an Unfired brittle; diseases or poisons are less debilitating and never fatal; they do not age; they are basically physically untiring; they need a little less sleep, and they need about half as much air and water (and can safely ingest salty water); and Old Flesh spells can replace food. Most notably, the Unfired don’t die normally, they just become completely inert at some point. To permanently slay one, they must be broken up, no clump greater than a fist touching another.

While an Unfired one will heal from literally any harm, regenerating from a pile of mulch, that healing is extremely sluggish. Even something a human would recover from will take three or so times as long for an Unfired. However, Old Flesh spells (and similar ones that involve soil or clay for beneficial effect) always gain an extreme Advantage when cast on an Unfired.

The Unfired feel things less than others. Pain is a distant, almost philosophical concern, but so is more positive sensation: they experience noticeably less hedonic pleasure from physical stimulation (Food holds less savor, soft things are less cuddly, sex doesn’t feel as good, etc). Some believe either as a consequence, or fundamentally, the Unfired lose some of their “humanity”.

Unfired change their appearance by using Old Flesh magic to make changes to their body. These are mostly cosmetic (making their limb thicker will make them a little stronger, but they are still half biological, and must exercise to truly build and incorporate strength). Non-human anatomy generally works poorly, as does being less than half or more than twice the scale you were. An Unfired may adopt a hulking, golem-like appearance that makes them stronger and more durable, but it worsens any mental effects of being Unfired and often leads to depersonalization. As time passes, it may be possible to gain more control.
