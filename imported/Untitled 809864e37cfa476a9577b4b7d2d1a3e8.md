The Thaumaturge's Arena awaits! Staffed by some of the best mages from around the world, hopeful young contenders come here to face their challenges, and eventually confront an Iron Mage directly. You have been tapped with the offer to host and produce this exciting new show. Your exact schedule and responsibilities are flexible, but you'll need to do some set of scouting talent, negotiating with networks, deciding on direction and themes, and of course be on set for shooting. No matter how you arrange things, it wonâ€™t be a small time investment, but in return you'll have a generous budget for research and travel, a sizeable salary, and points on gross and licensing. Depending on effort and luck, you'll get from hundreds of thousands to millions a year, but much more importantly, on the table is personal fame, influence and connections in both show business and the thaumaturgical community. You stand to become the public face of magic to most of the world, with all the ability to sway opinion that implies.
