You're in the good graces of the leadership of the foremost "supernatural threat countermeasure equipped" private military companies in the world. Monster hunts; magically enhanced security for areas, facilities, or individuals; specialized extractions; or augmenting military operations for countries across the world; they do it all with their eclectic staff of capable thaumaturges and other specialists. Expect occasional free services (training exercises to train rookies), tactical advice, and priority and cut rates. You have a standing offer to join as an officer, if you care to (and are willing to undergo their grueling training course). Their medical mages, artificers, and engineers are top notch. They are mercenaries; while theyâ€™re professional, they are still generally not nice people. They will never violate their contracts, but won't follow you into hell (there's a clause about that).
