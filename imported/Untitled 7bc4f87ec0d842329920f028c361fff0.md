You've gotten on the good side of this capable military contractor. Each squad works semi-independently and consists of one military-grade thaumaturge and a half-dozen trained soldiers outfitted in magical gear. They occasionally offer you free short term services (“It’s a training exercise for the rookies, you’d be doing us a favor. But no really normally we charge $300,000 for this”). They offer you priority and cut rates on jobs, but are unwilling to break existing contracts, no matter how urgent your need might be. They do extractions, patrols, recons, and small scale aggressions (they don’t do assassination, no, really, honest. It’s a legitimate mission, promise). They are mercenaries; while they’re fairly professional, they are still generally not nice people. Have a care what you hire them for. They will absolutely never double cross you, but that doesn’t mean they’re going to follow you into literal hell--there’s a clause in their contract about that.
