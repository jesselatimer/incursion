Forests, deserts, the deep oceans, the untouched mountains, every bastion of nature across the world blooms with aether. Malevolent beasts haunt the edges of countries, feasting specifically on human intelligence and magic. The weather itself seems to have a will and it is one that stands against humanity. Travel is orders of magnitude more risky, and infrastructure is obliterated in many places. The specter of famine looms large because of dangers to farms and transportation networks. Through sheer metaphysical might, the wilderness has begun to turn back the tide of civilization.

An incomplete list of dangers:

- High Storms: magical weather, these can take the form of walls of wind and water that come from nowhere, and hammer cities more dramatically than any attack by trolls or landsharks. Other variations include manifestations of sentient lightning beasts, blood rain that vampirically drain humans to strengthen itself, and fungal snow that controls minds.
- Leviathans: vast, amorphous monsters that rise unexpectedly from the deep and can swallow fleets entire.
- Lotus Poppy: this plant exudes a potent soporific and hallucinogenic vapor that knocks humans out, sending them into idyllic dreams that are the flower’s food; most never shake off the stupor before starvation or something else gets them.
- Goblin Wolves: diseased looking, oversized wolves with the heads of bats and faces of especially ugly monkeys. They are sapient, if just barely, and possess a vicious cunning and cruel cleverness, along with forepaws are almost as dextrous as human hands. They enjoy eating humans because they are sadists, but also like to steal toys and tools.
- Saurians: looking like various oversized dinosaurs and other ancient reptiloids (such a pterodactyls), these creatures are extremely aggressive and magically empowered; sometimes just physically, but some have thaumaturgy or natural magic too. It seems like there may even be intelligent leaders coordinating their actions.

There is a silver lining: the mystical flora, fauna, and natural phenomena of the deep woods hold potent magical power, ripe for human use. Though of course, this means little to humanity at large, which has a hard enough time surviving.

*Boons*

You gain the following Pact:

### Primal Harmony

You have become attuned with primordial nature itself. You are physically improved; gaining strength, speed, coordination, hardiness, and especially endurance and stamina; and the ceiling for these qualities is well above human. You have incredible intuition relating to wild places: you readily find and identify the safest shelters, quickest paths, heartiest food, and greatest natural treasures. You know how to fashion potent tools and elixirs from the bounty of the wilds.

*Victory*

This fight continues forever. There’s no specific stopping point, but the journey is its own reward. With your primal vigor you’re entirely capable of living out a long and interesting life in the wilderness, and every year you’ll only get better at it: you’ll unearth more treasures, hunt more incredible beasts, understand more exotic phenomena. But you can also aid humanity: comprehend and catalogue the most fantastic beasts, plants, and weather, giving civilization more options to build durable infrastructure or to travel safely, and help a threatened humanity find a balance with the more brutal world they’re in.
