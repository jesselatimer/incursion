Spells:

- You can cast spells that realign the correlation frame between your personal space and everything outside it. That is, you can “shrink” or “grow”. The limits are about one fifteenth (1/15) to about six (6) times your scale (eg, for an average person, a height between 4″ to 30′). Because you stay essentially the same, you'll be able to do things like support your own body weight, breathe, and move normally. When you grow, you can effectively imagine the world around you getting smaller, but denser and faster. And when you shrink, you'll be able to treat the world as getting larger, but less dense, and slower. The air will be noticeably thicker to you; when you fall, it'll feel faster than it should, but the impact is less likely to hurt you. Aether demands are proportional to scale.
