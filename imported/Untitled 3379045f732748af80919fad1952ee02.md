Spells:

- You gain spells that let you transform any "original material" (mud, soil, clay, wood dust or pulp, ash (only from burned wood), or similar) into a kind of pseudo-flesh. If you do this to material packed into a wound, the flesh joins with that of the injured one, healing it. This always works, with no infection or chance of rejection, but if your aether control is poor, the result may be crude, misshapen or feel weird or unpleasant. You can usually restore function to a crippled limb or injured organ, but can't replace a missing one. Purposefully "healing" someone "wrong" (eg, sealing over someone's mouth or gluing an arm to a body) requires a dozen times more aether, and the change is likely to wither away shortly.
