You’ve been loaned a replacement for your left arm, apparently made of black metal. One day it wasn’t there, and now it is, smoothly melding with your flesh around the shoulder. It’s humanoid, but overlong, hanging to your knee. The hand is noticeably elegant. While it doesn’t feel cold to you, it does to others. It’s heavy, and throws off your balance, but it somehow produces no excess strain on your shoulder.

It is remarkably stronger than a normal arm, but more than that it's nearly indefatigable. It is not utterly immune to harm, but it is certainly durable beyond the works or reasoning of men, and steadily restores itself from nothing if it is ever damaged. Your sense of touch works quite well through it, but you experience no pain from these sensations. Metagliss is extremely resistant to spells that attempt to affect it directly, and it will corrode all magic that it touches.This can let you parry magic--and it will occasionally do so of its own accord--including Sword of the Art, though it will likely be harmed in doing so. When touching any mage that isn't you, they will feel their conduit being taxed at a great rate, though this tax heals in seconds once the arm has released them. It is not sapient, or so you hope, but it seeks something. Something dangerous. It shifts uneasily while you sleep. It is not really your arm, it's just being loaned.
