Spells:

- You can find and identify magical beasts
- You can communicate complex concepts to even animal-intelligence magical beasts, as either a telepathic message, or via an ability to make bestial noises that are somehow comprehensible to them.
- You can permanently bond with an animal (this reserves some of your conduit). When you’re close enough to a bonded animal, you can both share some senses and crude concepts and plans. Costs scale with the power and intelligence of the animal. It is also more efficient if the beast agrees with it and benefits from it, but can be done against its will.
- You can lay a compulsion on a bonded animal. This can include open-ended orders, and even complex strategies, despite the beast’s intelligence. Costs scale with the intelligence and willpower of the animal, and is *much* more aether efficient if the animal consents on some level.
