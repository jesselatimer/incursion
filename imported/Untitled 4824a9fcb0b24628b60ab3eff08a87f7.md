A large, gold thumb-ring, with a chalcedony cameo. Within it dwells a djinn, paying off ancient crimes. The djinn is a spirit with incredible speed and some natural command over fire and air. It is barred from harming animate beings. It can only move about ten pounds at a time with its air, but it is shockingly fast, living at an accelerated pace, so it can do the work of many people. Its straight line speed is over nine thousand miles per hour. Its mind is incomprehensible to a human, and vice versa, but the ring translates your desires into commands, which it will do tirelessly and without complaint. It can eg, recognize the recipients of messages, but don't expect good results from very abstract tasks. It is competent but not exemplary at nearly any physical job set to it, from cleaning to tailoring to plumbing to carving. It roughly understands what sorts of things are dangerous to a person and will attempt to rescue you from danger without you needing to ask. The djinn cannot be permanently harmed or even trapped so long as its ring still exists, and the ring can only be harmed by specific magics. The djinn recognizes only you as its master, unless you, in sound mind, absent coercion, explicitly gift or sell the ring.
