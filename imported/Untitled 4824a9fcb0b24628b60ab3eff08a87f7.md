A large, gold, thumb ring with a chalcedony cameo. It contains a djinn: a small, devoted spirit that can perform various simple, useful tasks. It will only obey your commands unless you give permission to someone else; and it always recognizes you as its true owner until you die. It will prevent others from donning the ring, and will move the ring back to you if it’s lost. The djinn is a small figure of flickering light that is difficult for most to see. It moves at incredible, shocking speeds, circumnavigating the world in about two hours. It weighs almost nothing and can run across the surface of water. It can slip through very fine gaps, and carry about ten pounds while still moving at full speed. It can clean things instantly and has control over fires, letting it ignite fuel and making it burn faster at will. There is very little capable of harming the djinn, and even if “destroyed” it will regenerate inside the ring after a day. It is commanded by rubbing the ring and imagining your orders. It will activate automatically to save you if you are unconscious and it can do something.
