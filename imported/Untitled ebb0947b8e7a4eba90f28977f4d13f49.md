A globe-spanning trans-ecumenical organization that formed rapidly after the Incursion, almost as if someone had advance warning. Monastaries and nunneries of many disparate creeds and faiths have made a pact of mutual assistance, consolidating resources and knowledge. Their mission statement is to protect humanity in the physical, metaphysical, and spiritual realms. They are conservative, and while they do much to save the innocent from monsters and disasters, they can also be heavy handed against humans who stray too far outside their codes. They've identified you as an ally (even if you have ideological differences), and want to help your cause—and also hope you’ll return the favor every now and again. Their aid is dependent on availability and priority--causes they deem more important or urgent will engender more direct help. You can almost always gain access to their extensive libraries, fed by a broad and deep global information network. They have their pulse on current affairs--politics, movements of the powerful, and the zeitgeist of the little people--but their true specialty lies in the many fragments of memory, found texts, and strange intuitions that they've assembled into a largely-coherent history of the Incursion and world (or worlds) that collided with ours. They can also sometimes offer secure places to lay low, access to mid-grade thaumaturges or warrior-priests, the sparse gate network they've built between some of their strongholds, and more.
