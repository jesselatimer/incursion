- You may cast spells on a person or group that compel them to follow an order from you (note the spell doesn't convey the order, you must say or otherwise communicate it). More aether makes for a stronger compulsion, but there are limits: if there's practically no chance somebody would follow that order from anybody, all the aether in the world will only make them realize you're attempting to magically affect them. On the other hand, many people are uncertain, and reasonable commands can sway them. People with some esteem disorders or magical injuries to their mind can be very susceptible. The effect is stronger (or needs less aether) on people you have a legitimate authority over, especially those you've convinced to directly swear fealty to you. Too many strong, edge case orders to one person eventually either causes magical mental injury, or renders them completely immune to your keter spells.
