### Interactions

**Ferinus Khanate** x **Thaumic Contamination**
The empire is fundamentally short sighted, and refuses to use the less efficient safe casting techniques while on a war footing. In the meantime, they enjoy the way it weakens resistance to them, while they’ve managed to enslave protective magical beasts that shield their most loyal troops and a handful of citizens. They constantly say that they’ll fix everything once they have the control to do so, but Octarine Peace predicts that even were they to have an immediate and swift victory, it would be too late.

**Ferinus Khanate x Fantasia**
The ranks of the Khanate grow strong indeed with the bounty of magical creatures they can enslave. However, there are far more than they can control directly, so their insistence on waging war while everyone in the world is beleaguered is especially thoughtless and destructive.

**Ferinus Khanate x Unaussprechlichen Kulten**
The cult has fully infiltrated the ranks of the Khanate, in essence, theirs will be the state religion, and in return, the khanate is fed useful information (especially about you, if you oppose either or both of them) and its enemies are weakened from within.

**Ferinus Khanate x Angelic Ascendancy
T**he angels immediately see the benefit of a united world government. Under them. They accrue debts from both sides by aiding them in deniable ways, but nevertheless chart a path of fate that inexorably leads to the Khans as their puppet government over the entire world.

**Ferinus Khanate x Dawning of the Black Sun**
The Empress's own prophets, seeking not to be executed, tell her the sun darkening is but an omen of her reign to come. Her own growing delusions and paranoia do little to halt her armies' spread. The final defenses of the world are overrun by monsters barely tamed, their efforts to stop the bleeding sun put to ruin. In the end, even the monsters go mad. Game over, you lose.

**Thaumic Contamination x Fantasia**
Thaumaturges are one of the few tools humanity has in the war against the monsters of the Fantastic Wilds and with coordination between groups so difficult, few communities are willing to trust people telling them they need to use magic more efficiently, even as their increased concentration and inability to move about inundate them with blight specters and health problems (which they assume are a symptom of the ever spreading wilds).

**Thaumic Contamination x Unaussprechlichen Kulten**
Fear and confusion are valuable tools to the cult. They sabotage Octarine Peace’s efforts and blame the contamination on whatever group they feel might impede their control.

**Thaumic Contamination x Angelic Ascendancy**
The contamination is an extremely reliable source of debt for the angels, not just healing contamination injuries and banishing blight spectres, but teaching a group clean casting methods gives them long term leverage. And of course they undermine Octarine Peace whenever possible, to be sure they’re the ones that get that advantage.

**Thaumic Contamination x Dawning of the Black Sun**
Not only is the sun bleeding and the world descending into delusion and darkness, but magic itself fights against you. Without magic, you cannot win. Game over, you lose.

**Fantasia x Unaussprechlichen Kulten**
As always, division and fear and hardship always serves the interests of manipulative people ensconced in power. With their Guidance, agents, and communication rituals, marshalling humanity to their drum is easier than ever. And if their efforts impede humanity’s survival, well… as far as they’re concerned, if they can’t rule humanity, it shouldn’t exist.

**Fantasia x Angelic Ascendancy
T**he angel’s war is half won by the wilds. Their end goal is small, isolated groups of humans that they use as farms. By curating and protecting such communities, they become beloved protectors. In many of these they could probably be completely public about their dietary habits and have it accepted as a reasonable cost.

**Fantasia x Dawning of the Black Sun**
The wells of madness and dark sun’s blood being embedded in deep wilderness have wild and unpredictable effects, ruining natural treasures and worsening deadly monsters. How can humanity survive when they don’t know if an attack at any given moment is inside their own minds or the result of a monster driven mad?

**Unaussprechlichen Kulten x Angelic Ascendancy**
The cult’s Guidance rituals immediately tell them to ally with the angels, and the angels have no problem at all treating their favored servants well. Working together, they both get what they want much more rapidly.

**Unaussprechlichen Kulten x Dawning of the Black Sun**
Perhaps this was the true purpose of the cult all along, perhaps this is the instantiation of everything they worked for. Perhaps those that know the unspeakable rituals shall not just survive but thrive in strange new forms on the other side of a black and bleeding dawn. Whatever the case, their rituals immanentize the Dawning, drawing it closer, day by day, until it is immediate. Game over, you lose.

**Angelic Ascendancy x Dawning of the Black Sun**
The Angels are immune to the effects of the Black Sun, and know a way to save humanity from the Dawning. They do so, and immediately reify that magical debt, claiming the entire future of every member of the entire human race. So huge, so absolute, that literally all of humanity becomes their debt slaves for as long as it survives (which under the administrations of the choir, is likely a long long time). Game over, you lose.
