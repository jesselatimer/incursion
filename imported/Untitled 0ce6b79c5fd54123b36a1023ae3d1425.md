The bones of the earth have become your own; you are always aware of the reassuring pulse of the Earth's core. This Talent grants access to potent but crude geo-kinesis.

Inherent: A connection to "proper ground" makes you feel sturdier and more sure-footed, and gives you a crude "seismic sense" of things like stone walls, or voids and tunnels within a few meters. Proper ground is a sufficient quantity of "natural earth material" such as soil, sand, or gravel; or anything solid enough directly connected to same, such as wood floor directly over earth, but not a similar floor over a basement or other open space.
