A crystalline vial full of glittering silvery gunk that smells of peaches, apples, and, strangely, tears. When consumed, it cures all present illnesses, corrects physical flaws and improves your health overall. It will regrow limbs missing at the time of drinking because of deformity or maiming. It also regrows tonsils, appendixes, etc, and these are unlikely to fail again. All illnesses and disorders are cured, whatever the source (genetic, fetal, bacterial, malnutrition, etc.). It doesn’t intrinsically make you more attractive, but it removes many things that could make you unattractive. You will find it easier to maintain a healthy weight, your hair becomes glossy and strong, and your skin will be blemish free and gain wrinkles quite slowly. You tan more easily. Your vision is better than normal and will not deteriorate as you age. You are nearly supernaturally resistant to chemical dependency (though it doesn’t protect you from the mental aspect). You are almost immune to cancer. Beyond these, you are a very healthy (but to a natural degree) human. Given your cancer resistance and health, you are very likely to live to 120 or so.
