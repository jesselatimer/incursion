A smooth grey stone that is hot to the touch. Have you ever wanted to be someone else? Just hold this this, and with an act of will it and your old self will crumble to ash, and a new you will form from the remains. You can choose a sex and age, and basic details of appearance for free (note that decreasing age doesn’t heal injuries you’ve sustained). You can then choose physical, mental, and personality traits as if playing a kind of CYOA, trading them in a somewhat fair way. It has relatively few options for outright intelligence improvement, and there are limits on min-maxing by taking detriments for positives. You may also edit your memories and background; the stone has a good natural ability to fill gaps in a coherent way. This creates a sort of glamour that will make people not question the difference: for instance, if you remove yourself from your family, your family members will not think about your absence unless it’s pointed out to them. For example, if you change yourself from an American man to a British woman, your family hasn’t forgotten the male, American you, and they don’t invent a backstory for why you might be British, but they will naturally go along with the change, and won’t be alarmed even if it’s pointed out to them. The stone won’t otherwise change people, or make new history, but will provide necessary documentation for your new life, if desired.
