A mystical storm has made its home inside you, and rages forever. You gain spells to manifest weather related phenomena from your body.

Inherent: Your emotions run higher, and you become more impulsive and less inclined to stillness. You conduct electricity more easily, but are less harmed by it. You are less hindered by wind and water. You can predict incoming inclement weather, and have excellent instincts for currents and weather patterns. Being in a storm makes you happier and more relaxed.
