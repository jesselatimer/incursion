These enigmatic spirits are known as the fae, among many other things, because of their resemblance to old myths and legends, but be wary of many divergences. Though some believe the Incursion altered the past to include legends of them, others allege that they are nightmares that only ape our stories to put us at ease. Whatever the truth, they bear you a curious regard. You think they find you amusing. They play only less harmful pranks on you, and your enemies seem to suffer more than their fair share. You often find your house cleaned and your gear in miraculously good repair. Youâ€™re never the target of the wild hunt (though your friends may not get off so easily), and if caught by one in a bad mood, you might only be cursed to dance till unconsciousness, rather than to death. But most importantly, you always know their secret paths, those hidden in wilderness, by crossroads, and in various liminal spaces. You can travel to their safe and secure glades, impenetrable by normal means. You can always find your way back out, but sometimes not to exactly the right place or time. Deep within their fortress-that-is-a-forest you can find their elegantly terrifying court, and with wits and luck you might survive their capricious games to learn boons and secrets of magic undreamt of by mortal mages.
