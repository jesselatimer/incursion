Those that survive the Black Sun emerge stronger for it. All who have lived under the bleeding skies live richer and longer lives now that the stars shine clear. Aether is drawn from the pool of humanity's strength and wisdom, from its shared experiences, and this aether can be effortlessly shaped into tricks or spells of protection, creation, healing, or binding. Intuitive, automatic personal healing means every possessor’s lifespan is greatly extended, likely centuries barring violent death; they’re hardier and stronger than baseline humanity. Per Aspera ad Astra grants an empathic bond between everyone who wields it. Humanity will be more peaceful, more willing to see the good in others, more united against external threats. Per Aspera ad Astra breeds true: the children of someone with it will always inherit it. The accumulation of power leads to each generation growing stronger than the one before. In the distant future, when evolution and progress both magical and scientific has scattered humans of every shape, size, and paradigm to every burning star in the night sky; even then, some spark of this power will remain.
