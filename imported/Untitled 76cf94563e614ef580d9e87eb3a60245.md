An oversized oil-slick spear. It is supernaturally difficult to control, feeling unbalanced and awkward no matter how skilled the wielder. Its blade is supernaturally sharp, capable of permanently harming much that is otherwise invulnerable. It seems to be indestructible, and it absorbs magical force it contacts into its unending metaphysical depths. This property allows it to pierce or harm wards, leave wounds that don't respond to magical healing, disrupt the animating magic of golems and undead, and more.
