You have admitted and extended a scholarship to the world's foremost distance education school of magic (self-proclaimed). However shady they may seem, the exclusive Invisible College is world class in training aether control, teaching tricks, and investigations into magical phenomena. They also have mundane programs (which are, somehow, even accredited) that benefit from magic to optimize your educationâ€”you might learn up to twice as fast as usual. Their language acquistion speed courses guarantee conversational ability in under a year. You get eight (8) free credits each year (about half of a standard course load), plus expenses, for three-hundred twenty one (321) years, starting today. Extra credits are 6000USD per. If you exist, you recieve their correspondance (catalog, academic advisory, course materials, certifications), period. By regular mail if possible, by any means necessary if you're, eg, sunk in a box in the bottom of the sea. Scribble the correct sigil on your return mail, put it somewhere you can't see, and the college will receive it.
