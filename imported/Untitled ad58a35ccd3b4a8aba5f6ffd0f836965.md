This animal's shoulders are even with a tall man’s waist, her coat is a strange pale color that seems to constantly fade into the background, and her eyes burn with ghostly blue fire. But whenever that would attract undue negative attention, she abruptly looks like a slightly derpy Husky. She doesn’t really act like she understands English, but is clearly smarter and more aware than any mundane dog or wolf. She will take to training easily, and will answer to any name you choose to give her.

Natural Power: *Extremely Good Girl*

She has both passive and active supernatural enhancements to her strength, speed, and durability. She can quite easily and thoroughly see and harm the spiritual, and her bite is armor-piercing and stone-crushing. She can bark in a way that can immediately arouse to alertness and awareness either individuals or large groups of people. Though she has the naturally keen senses you’d expect of a wolf, she also clearly has a precognitive danger sense. In times of extreme need, her bark can momentarily subvert the will of nearby foes.
