A classic tool of magic, such as a wand, staff, tome or orb; its specific shape and style based on its unique personality. It enhances your magic: your effective Power is improved by 2 full points, and your aether control is noticeably boosted, in particular you waste less aether when casting quickly. It is attuned to you; you may permit others to use it but it will never be more than half as effective for them. It has no mind yet has a strong preference that it steadily, incessantly influences you towards every time you use it. Your tool is unique and you won't know it's personality until you find it, but it could be stern, a show-boat, compassionate, or nearly anything. This can't overwrite your own personality—though feel free to lean in—it won't, for example, turn a hermit into a social butterfly, but it can change how important that hermit finds being respected, though that can manifest differently (consider building a false reputation versus working diligently to demonstrate capability).
