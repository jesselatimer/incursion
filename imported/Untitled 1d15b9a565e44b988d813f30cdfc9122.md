A wand, staff, tome, or other classic magical tool. It enhances your magic and is attuned to you; others can use it, but it will never work as well for them. It improves your effective Power by 2 points when you use it, and boosts your skill in small ways. It is obviously magical to anyone with any kind of magic sense. It has something like a personality: it doesn’t talk to you, but it will always, subtly, uncaringly, exert influence on you towards its preferences. These preferences won’t be major and life altering, nor will they be purely negative or positive. A wizard tool couldn't turn you from a recluse into a social butterfly, but it might increase how important you find being respected, which over time might manifest in a number of different ways (building a false reputation as a powerful sage, working diligently to prove yourself, etc.).
