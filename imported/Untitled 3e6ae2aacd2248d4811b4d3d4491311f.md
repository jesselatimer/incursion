Your sense of the world is awash with the flow of aether, a cool wind that caresses your soul. You may extract aether from the geomantic energy present in the environment. Extracting aether diminishes the available energy, and there are many places where a single dedicated Thaumaturge could tap a locale dry for a time, though it will regenerate, usually in about a week. The less energy in a locale (whether naturally or as a result of thaumaturgy) the less aether a given draw extracts, and vice versa. Natural saturation of the Earthâ€™s energy varies from place to place: the world is a patchwork with varying peak levels, speed of regeneration, and the size of what counts as one locale. Variance in peak levels is not high, with only a bare handful of rare places with twice as much energy. Arcane Font grants you the passive ability to sense the flow of geomantic energy, meaning you naturally understand the quality of local energy, as well as that of adjacent regions, and can also tell the direction and strength of any nearby draws via Arcane Font. Arcane Font is a common Source, and is often the baseline for comparison with other Sources.
