The unspeakable cult began like any other: powerful men fooling around and making secret deals and arrangements. But they found something more, a cache of secret rituals that seem to defy the known principles of mundane thaumaturgy. Long before you become aware of them, they have already used these “unspeakable rituals”—along with other thaumaturgies born of the Incursion—to infiltrate positions of power worldwide. You don’t know their exact goals, but it’s obvious they want control, and the fact that they’re doing so in secret with such tools presages much potential ill.

The risks to you, personally, are relatively subtle. Why send a hired gun, confirming their active interest and presence, when a misplaced form could ruin your ability to disrupt their plans far better? They aren’t poisoned by pride, you see. Rendering you impotent in oblique ways is just as satisfying as actively destroying you. Expect to have your reputation smeared, your employers turned against you, doctored evidence pointing at your guilt to surface, and your favorite soft drink maker to go out of business. Fighting them will be a complex and exhausting endeavor of logic and information warfare. There will be very little opportunity for overt physical confrontation, cathartic as that would be.

The unspeakable rituals include, among others:

- Memory alteration, their most terrifying tool. This ritual allows them to forcibly remove a memory, and to implant false memories. It requires at least two cult members and anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours depending on how specific and complex the tampering is to be. More members make it more accurate/robust, not faster.
- Binding oaths. Possible between two practitioners only, this is what allows them guaranteed cooperation and goal alignment (you can’t play one full member off against another).
- True shapeshifting. The power for a consenting subject to completely change their body to a new form; even one younger and stronger. The transformation is truly physical, it *cannot* be directly detected or traced by any magic.
- Augmentation or creation of Agents. (It’s unclear whether they are homunculi, or altered humans, or both or something else.) Agents of the cult can communicate at short range in some undetectable, uncrackable way; they also seem to be unfailingly loyal and immune to pain. Some but not all (or is this appearance a ploy to confuse you?) can stop their heart on command, and some dissolve into inert dust when they die.
- Guidance, a tool of divination and augury, possibly the intervention of some secret god. It seems to have capricious limits and blind spots that you could slowly piece together, but is also capable of charting a course through the future in a way no thaumaturgy can match.

*Boons*

- You gain the Contact **Namer**
- You gain the Talent **Judging Eye**

*Victory*

Once you gain enough knowledge of the cult, its members, its operations, and especially its rituals, you can Speak the Name of the Unaussprechlichen Kulten. This obliterates all access to their strange rituals forever. You have also probably exposed all or several of the highest ranking members (though many are well connected enough that they probably had a very soft landing).

- You gain the contact: Cult Remnants. There were a lot of cult members who were not so deeply invested in it, but now they look to you for guidance. You can use or abuse this, or you can tell them to become a charitable organization. They’ll do it and well.
- Naming the Cult gives you a sudden and invigorating boost to your magical abilities. You gain X foundation points, and X talent points.
