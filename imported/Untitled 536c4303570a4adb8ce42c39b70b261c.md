All roads are one road, and your feet have Understood its true form. You are greatly advantaged when on any path improved by sapient minds: eg, roads, mining tunnels, paths humans have marked or shored up; but not  animal tracks or unaltered cave systems. Your load seems lighter, gas goes a little longer, you never get blisters on your feet or punctures in your tires. You have a perfect memory for paths you've traveled and for maps of roadways. You cannot get lost, period; not even hostile magic can do it. You get a tingle when traps or ambushes are nearby, and also get a feel for the vibes of fellow travelers and roadside establishments. You have uncanny luck in finding good places to stop and rest. Though it wears on you if done too much, you can travel between paths that are not connected, at least not in physical reality. You must be alone or in a small group of close companions, and must not be observed. As long as thereâ€™s a road there, you can be anywhere in the world in under an hour.
