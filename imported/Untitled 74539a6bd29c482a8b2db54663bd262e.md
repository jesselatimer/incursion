Her name is short for Bethany, but do not call her this if you value your current organ arrangement. Betty is grim, unflappable, and hard-as-nails, and she's making a name for herself as an elite anti-monster (or anti-thaumaturge) operative. She's 6’3” and 200 lbs, with the musculature and conditioning of an Olympic multi-athlete; once-in-a-generation reflexes; and the instincts of a natural scrapper and sharpshooter. She is skilled in the use and maintenance of nearly any kind of weapon and most vehicles. Her greatest asset is a genius-level grasp of tactics and strategy. In any fair fight, and most unfair ones, it's safe to bet on Betty. Her kind of abilities can't be taught, but if she's thrown in with your cause ("Most interesting game in town,") she's willing to give you what pointers she can.

Arsenal

Betty seems to have a particular knack for getting her hands on just the right sort of gear necessary to take down whatever target she's contracted to kill. Part of this is just her ability to plan ahead, and she's got secure caches in all kinds of weird out of the way places. She's managed to acquire all sorts of top of the line equipment that not for sale, even if you could afford it, from stealth drones to anti-magic bullets to protective amulets, and a frankly concerning collection of magical knives. Some people seem to react a bit strongly to the old looking sword that never leaves her side.
