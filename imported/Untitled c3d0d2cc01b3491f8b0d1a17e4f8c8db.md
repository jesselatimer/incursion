A beautifully carved pipe. Just holding it makes an herb scented smoke curl from your mouth and nostrils. Breathe through it and you cleanse your mind. Glamours fade; possessing spirits slumber; the call of addiction quells. Tiredness, short lived emotions, and egodystonic urges recede. Your memory becomes clearer and you become more patient, less given to frustration or anxiety, and so a better planner and strategist. It also wards away insects. Using it for more than six hours a day may cause tolerance, reducing its effectiveness.
