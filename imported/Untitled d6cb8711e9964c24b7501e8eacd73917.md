- ^ You have learned to prepare the next layer of secrets into your skins, and may now elect to preserve inherent supernatural properties of creatures. Note that thaumaturgy is not an inherent property, but the inherent benefits of Talents are, and some humans and other mundane animals have other inherent magic. This reserves about twice as much capacity as a mundane animal skin.
- ^ When you cast spells to become a creature, you may include access to any of its inherent magic you've preserved. "Passive" magic—eg, supernatural durability—increases the cost of the spell. "Active" magic—eg, a kirin's lightning calling or a werewolf's regeneration—draws your conduit, even if it cost nothing for the original creature.
