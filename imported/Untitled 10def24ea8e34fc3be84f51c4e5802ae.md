A new empire is arising in Central Asia. For some reason, a large, loosely connected family have all manifested a similar thaumaturgy that involves taming and controlling magical beasts. The matriarch of this family has declared herself an Empress, and seeks to bring the entire world under her rule.

The Khanate family’s abilities are quite strong. This is no tinpot upstart, and while they may not conquer the entire world, they’re definitely going to rule more than any single empire before them. Even if you’re very far away from the fighting, it has knock-on effects that cover the world. There’s an economic and population drag on nations involved (which will shortly be all of them). Deprivation, loss, and misery will be everywhere. As you have the remarkable powers of a True Mage, people will expect you to take part, and may vilify you if you don’t. The empire itself is not specifically, concertedly evil; but they are willing to visit the horrors of war on the world for the sake of avarice and powerlust. Their propaganda ministers tell the world that one rule will be more efficient and consistent, making life better for everyone; but in fact, their large and autarchy-based state is already rife with corruption and grief.

The Khanate has enslaved many mystical beasts with great special powers, and will continue to enslave more, increasing their power and flexibility, as they conquer more territory. The Ferinus Empress’s capacity for control is nigh limitless. It’s possible that they will pass a tipping point after which they’ll be unstoppable. They use their “living materiel” ruthlessly but strategically. An incomplete list of examples:

- Yetis are stealthy but brutally strong and cunning guerilla warriors.
- They can contest the skies against even advanced technology with the massive Kakyen.
- Olgoi Khorkhoi, the Death Worm, is a burrowing flatworm the size of a man that can spit and exude corrosive yellow poison.
- Yast Melkhii: The empress herself has bound a great turtle-dragon as her own personal siege weapon and mobile fortress. A great obsidian obelisk erupts from the shell of the Yast Melkhii, on which she has built a throne of platinum and jade.
