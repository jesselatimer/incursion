Every now and then you get a call, on the other end is a man, and that man will offer you a job. You don't know his goals or intentions, but he's never asked you to do something that cuts against your moral fiber. The missions vary in length, difficulty, support, and rewards, but they're always worth your while. Even setting aside the cash payout, you frequently find information and insight, and meet useful people to know. Stakeouts, detective work, bodyguarding, a lot of jobs start out boring, but they rarely stay that way.
