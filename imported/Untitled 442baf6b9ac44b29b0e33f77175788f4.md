- You can cast spells that let you manipulate the shapes of inanimate things you can touch, molding most mundane materials like clay, except better, because with sufficient skill you can make changes finer than your fingers could, or even inside of things.
- Your spells can raise or lower the temperature of things you can touch; costs increase exponentially outside the range of freezing/boiling water. This takes longer to do on living things, and is practically impossible on non-consenting sentient beings.
- Your spells let you alter some physical properties of things you can touch. You can stretch or shrink it in any direction, and/or alter mass, hardness, heat capacity, magnetism, conductivity, and many similar properties (costs based on proportional change). Affecting living things is more difficult, requires more time and more energy, and is nearly impossible if the subject is resisting. These changes are usually temporary but with very high control, requiring extended casting, you can make most changes permanent.
