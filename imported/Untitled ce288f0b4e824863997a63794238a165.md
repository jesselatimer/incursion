Infuriatingly enigmatic and cryptic. Utterly creepy. Pigtails, a jumper that went out of style a century ago. An irritatingly high pitched voice. You’re honestly not sure she isn’t a hallucination. She certainly shows up in places you would’ve said it was impossible for others to follow you, and cunningly stays out of sight of anyone else. She offers a fairly regular stream of insight. She has details that no Earthly source could give you, answers to questions you would not have thought to ask, and warnings delivered just in time. As far as you have seen, she is always correct. The clarity of her information ranges from cryptic riddles to precise verbal dossiers. She does not respond to your questions, and only speaks her piece. Sometimes, however, you see something in her eyes. A glint of need, of hunger. You wonder why she helps you.
