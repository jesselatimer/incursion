Bitterness has churned within your stomach and coursed in your blood since the day you first tasted the fruits of death. Violence spills a power into the world, and in a quasi-physical act, you may consume it, deriving aether. The more harm is done, the more of this death energy is created; the more psychic trauma involved, the longer it clings to the world. For example: the peaceful death of a human being creates a vast amount of energy that dissipates within a day. A trivial but torturous injury inflicted maliciously will produce meager energy that clings for years. Sophonts generate an order of magnitude more than non-Sophonts: a human being dying makes more Aether than ten typical necrophages could consume at once. For Necrophagy, **tax is not based on strength of draw**, but rather, range. If you are adjacent to the energy draws are trivial, while 100 meters is a strong draw for average Capacity. Necrophagy can also sustain you, replacing food, water, and air instead of granting aether. However, consuming too much death energy leaves its mark, causing you to appear wasted or injured, and your spiritual form becomes dim and bleak. If you cease using Necrophagy, you’ll recover in about as much time as you’ve been under the wasting (perhaps longer in extreme cases).
