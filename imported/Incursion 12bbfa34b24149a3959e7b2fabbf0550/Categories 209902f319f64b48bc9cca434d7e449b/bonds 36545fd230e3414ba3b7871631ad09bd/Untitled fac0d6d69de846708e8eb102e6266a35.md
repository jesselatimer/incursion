Bonds are people, organizations, forces, or objects that are mystically connected to you. This connection is rare, and is always beneficial. These things are almost fated to be with you. You can still offend an ally or a contact beyond their tolerance, items can be destroyed or stolen, and pacts can be broken; all of these things are significantly harder and less likely than would be the case with a mundane friend, associate, possession, or contract. Bonds do not require the casting of spells to use unless stated otherwise.

Bonds come in four flavors:

- Allies, powerful companions that offer you direct aid
- Artifacts, powerful items
- Contacts, individuals or organizations that help you indirectly
- Pacts, contracts with supernatural forces

Start with 6 bond points.
