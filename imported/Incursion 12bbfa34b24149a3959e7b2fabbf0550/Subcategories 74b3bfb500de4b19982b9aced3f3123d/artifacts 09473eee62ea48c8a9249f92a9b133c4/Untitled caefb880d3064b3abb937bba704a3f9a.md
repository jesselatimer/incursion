Though the magic to create magical items clearly exists in Post-Incursion Earth, some of these seem to be artifacts of the Incursion itself, either from the old world, or as a bizarre side-effect of the intersection. Eventually, research and development might match some of these items in specific degrees of ability or power, but many are also unique and will never be duplicated.
