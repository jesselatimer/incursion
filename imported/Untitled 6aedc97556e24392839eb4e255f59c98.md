Though the true wyrms have not physically survived the Incursion, some lingering figment of one has bound itself to you, granting you the power of a dragon's senses. You are aware of streams of magic from all Sources and Methods as something like visual phenomena--paths of luminescence. You cannot be surprised by a spell cast in your visual range if you're paying attention--though it may still be cast too quickly for you to react. You retain this sense even if blind or with closed eyes, but most physical barriers that stop light will block whatever it is you sense, as will strong spiritual barriers. You can navigate via this sense in areas with background aether, and if you concentrate, you can recognize an individualâ€™s thaumological signature. Sufficient familiarity with a type of spell allows you to detect when it has been used after the fact.
