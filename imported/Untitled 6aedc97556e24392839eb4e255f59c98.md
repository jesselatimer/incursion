There are no true wyrms on Earth, and yet, there are echos, as if they were. Some figment of a dragon has infused you with their powerful magic sense. This sense extends in all directions, up to 300 feet, though is clearer in front of you. It can be blocked by living stone, special material, or specialized wards, but it can't be overwhelmed (there's no "magic sense flashbang"), and you know of no way to deceive it. There's usually enough ambient magical energy for you to navigate blindfolded. A thing's magical nature is clearer to you than its color, and casting as obvious as shouting. Magic lingers and leaves trails of disruption: you can tell when magic was used days later, and can track magic and magical beings. With time and practice you can identify a thaumaturge's Aspects on sight, or tell what magic one is molding as they begin casting. This sense doesn't extend to the spiritual, though you can see any magic spirits use that affects the physical world. Being able to see your own casting slightly improves your control.
