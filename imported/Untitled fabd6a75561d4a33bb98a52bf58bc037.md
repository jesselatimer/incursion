The cold breath of the grave is in you, an awareness of a strange and restless power across an invisible threshold. This Talent lets you cast spells related to death and the undead.

Inherent: You gain an intuitive "death sense," you can feel it when something near you dies or died recently. You can see and converse with spirits of the dead, or beings closely related to death (but not other spiritual entities).
