A pair of ornate, old-fashioned pistols, one small one large. Load the smaller (брать), with a trick, and it fires a spiritual projectile that does no harm, instead "tagging" whatever it strikes. Until it dissolves the tag empowers the larger gun (давать) to fire bullets enhanced by its subject. Stone makes cannonball like rounds that shatter, metal makes flechettes or armor penetrating rods, flesh of any sort makes a 'smart' bullet that tracks targets, spirit entities make spiritual bullets that sap energy from living targets or harm spiritual ones. Tagging magical effects will emulate some of that thing's effect (such as wards creating large "nets" or "bursts" that trap or knock aside magic). And thaumaturges and magical creatures create bullets that mimic some of their powers.
