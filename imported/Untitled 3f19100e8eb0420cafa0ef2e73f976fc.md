A pair of ornate old-fashioned pistols, one small, one large. Neither takes ammunition. The smaller gun (брать) fires a spiritual bullet that does no harm and binds to whatever it strikes. The larger (давать) can only fire once the first has struck something, and until that “tag” wears off, it fires bullets empowered by whatever брать struck. Stone of various types makes slow, hard bullets that shatter into shrapnel. Flesh makes the bullets guided. Metal makes high velocity bullets that might be flechettes or armor-piercing depending on the metal. Wards make bullets that can blast aside oncoming magic. Tagging thaumaturges or magical creatures creates bullets empowered with some portion of their Talents, and давать will tax their conduit slightly every time it fires.
