Money. Money. Money. Money. Money makes the world go round. And for some reason this enigmatic group of venture capitalists has determined that giving you some will turn the world favorably for them. You are granted one million USD (or equivalent), post tax, per annum, indefinitely. (Adjusts for real buying power; income not guaranteed in total collapse of civilization). Don’t try to contact them, don’t try to track them down. Just… enjoy it.
