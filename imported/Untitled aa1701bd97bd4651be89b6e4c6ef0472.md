This short, slender octagonal rod of an indefinable color makes you immune to the contamination as long as itâ€™s on your person, allowing you to cast with no efficiency penalty while remaining clean. The Purity Rod has chosen you as an agent of cleansing strength; if you abandon this calling, it will leave you for another.
