- You may cast a spell that “overclocks” your clockwork mind (whether you are in this mode or it's doing something in parallel), letting it run from 50–300% faster (higher speeds require both more skill and aether).
- ^ When creating a TAP, the action may now include spell casting other than clockwork mind spells. These TAPs reserve about twice as much conduit as physical ones. Source and Method must be set in advance, and it still needs to be a spell you are capable of casting that fast (though the fact that you're doing it instinctively will help your speed, but it also puts a ceiling on the skill you can put into it). The spell's function is still limited and needs to be quick and relatively specific (eg, someone points a knife at me->I cast a Heart of Flame+Psychic+Steel Step spell that slaps it to the ground).
