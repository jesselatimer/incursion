Spells:

- Your spells may create glamours. Glamours are subtle alterations in the weft and weave of the world that will convey impressions to any mind capable of interpreting them, which can be attached to a place or object. They are not directly perceived, nor are they direct afflictions on a mind. So they can't fool automatic sensors, but recordings of a glamour will still affect viewers. The more "open to interpretation" the impression is, the better; more specific is more difficult. A glamour to make a smooth object seem rough, red hair seem black, broth smell like cinnamon, or a butter knife seem like a sword are very difficult; much easier is making a texture seem unpleasant, hair seem elegantly styled, broth taste sweet or just 'good', or an object seem *dangerous*. In particular, there's no glamour of invisibility (or if there were, it would draw attention to itself, since viewers would be confused about how they can see something that "should" be invisible).
