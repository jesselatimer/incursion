Spells:

- Your spells can conjure a floating weapon. It is obviously magical (eg, it may glow, crackle with lightning, sing, inhale light, or etc) and despite the name, may appear as nearly any hand to hand weapon; note you don't choose the form, it's one appropriate to your personality and the circumstances. It can only exist in our reality for about twelve seconds before it returns to a higher realm. It follows you automatically, and at your direction (or according to circumstances you create in the spell), it lashes out, near-instantly striking with obliterating force, after which it dissipates. It's standard range is about three meters. You may "tune" its various properties as casting the spell, such as increasing the range (up to ten meters), letting it make multiple (weaker attacks), or how it causes harm. The standard attack is a broad slash of kinetic energy and spirit destroying fire; this can be changed to different shapes (narrow slashes, a wide hammer), only physical damage, only spiritual damage, or more exotic features such as stealing heat, only cutting living flesh and not inert material, destroying someone's immune system or mental health, or severing spells, parrying non-physical attacks, etc.
